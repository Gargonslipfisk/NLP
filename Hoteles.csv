"10","The carpet in the room was stained from a previous flooding from the bathrooom which also needed som regrouting of the tiles.  The ventilater extractor did not appear to be working.  The television was old and some fascilities did not work on it but we didn't go there to watch television.  The food in the restaurant was limited and repetitive . I asked on our application for "" Soya "" products due to a dietary problem with Dairy products but no notice was taken of my request.  So I obtained all products from a local supermarket within 200 yards of the hotel. I would suggest the Management staff spend a night at the Ramada Viking Hotel in Waterford and sample the breakfast and food on offer and the attention of the staff in every detail as the cost of a stay and for the food on offer is about the same but the difference in vast."

"47","The hotel  may not be modern but it has character and charm.  The room we had (superior) was small but adequate.  The bedroom and bathroom were clean, the bed was comfy, there were coffee making facilities in the room, free wi-fi - what more do you need on a city break.  The staff were pleasant, anything you need you only had to ask.  There was a good variety on the breakfast buffet - cereals, yoghurt, fruit, meats, cheeses, salad, breads and croissants, and of course Danish pastries - and all of good quality.  The hotel allowed us to leave our luggage on the day of departure and we came to collect it just before we needed to leave for the airport.  All in all, I thought the hotel was lovely and really enjoyed our stay here."

Air-conditioner was not effective  Maids come to clean the room but did not replace fresh towels after removing the soiled one.  Taxis outside hotel are daylight robbers as they operate without meters.  I have to get hotel staff to book metered Golden bird or AA taxis and I have to board the taxis at the basement carpark as I was told these taxis cannot pick up passengers at the hotel driveway.  Buffet breakfast need improvement as the buffet spread looked unappetizing and lack choice. Service staff need more training to manage the guest "

There was a small dryer and a small dishwasher, but that didn't work out as something I was willing to wash clothes in.  The surrounding area is not nice but did not seem dangerous.  A few local restaurants and a Chinese Walmart will keep you going in between your trips to Shanghai.  I would stay in the French Concession or Bund if you can afford it.  If not, this is a clean, cheap place to stay."

An excellent touch!"

I felt from her there no customer service at all. I will stay at the copthorne again and have recommended it to others but I will not use your wed site again or recommended it to others it will in fact be the opposite. "

"100","The room itself was spartan but clean and the air con worked well. There were no blankets, however, and although the manageress said she'd switched on our cooker and fridge from reception, they did not work. When we tried to remedy this the next morning and also get the WiFi key, we found the office closed. The manageress finally opened up at 11am, her excuse was that she opened so late because she had a headache.   In summary, a nice place in an excellent location, spoiled by poor management. Thank goodness we got such a good deal from Hotelopia, it's not worth paying the full rate - 90 Euro - to stay there."
"101","For the less than 50 euro’s per night it’s a very good deal (value for money)"
"102","The hotel is located between the airport and the city. If you go early in the morning or late afternoon to the center, then it takes you at least 30 minutes to get to there."

"106","One end of the hotel is very close to a roundabout and a road runs behind as well. There can be traffic noise because of this, I found weekends worse as there were more noisey motorbikes.  Some of the hotels room furnishings are a bit worn out. Self catering facilities fairly basic (but all clean).  Don't let this put you off, for the price this is a very good hotel and without exception the staff are all lovely.  "
"107","I was very disappointed. Upon entering the hotel no one was there togreet us, never mind help us with our bags. The rooms were very dated, smelt very musty and the chair in our first room was torn. I phoned reception to complain and waited for twelve minutes but no one picked up. Evenjtuly I went downstairs to complain.  After waiting ten minuss to see the manager i witnessed that no one else was greeted or helped with their bags either, including a man with disqbility. We were shown to another room which wasn't too much of an improvement on the first.   For the price we paid I was shocked at the standard of the service and the rooms. "
"108","The nicest staff I ever met in a hotel"
"109","A lot of facilities. Good information and help at the reception. Very usefull that gasts can book a trip at the reception. Good information for trips in many languages. Friendly staff of all people working in the hotel. Very good food for a reasonable price. Good service in the dinningroom, good and quick technical service. Very quick respons after our message that the tv was not working in the room. Warm water in the swimmingpool. Enough sunbeds and place around the swimmingpool. Large appartments with good equipment, a large bathroom and balcony. Always warm and enough water in the shower in the appartment. A hairdrier and safety box in the appartment. Free internet all over the hotel! "
"110","The only important thing we can mention is that it is a pitty that the bedroom in the appartments is located just next to the corridor. This can be very disturbing late in the evening, when people are walking and talking through the corridor. Another negative thing is that there is no window which can be opened in the bedroom. We are used to sleep with open window. After the first night with disturbance, we moved our beds to the livingroom / kitchen, which was a good sollution! So we had a good sleep after all during the rest of our holliday.   A less important complaint is that you have to pay 1 euro to use the scale to weight your luggage. This should be free. The weight from the same luggage was not the same at the airport, so it did not help us much to use the scale.   The instruction (in signs) to use the safety-box was not clear, since we could not mannage to close the box. It would be helpfull to have an extra written instruction.   "
"111","The apartement was nice and big with lots of light. It also had a nice view of th garden, even though it was located one floor below  street level. We felt imediatly at home there. We would stay there again."
"112","Some of the furniture (kitchen) was a little worn, but still working fine. While the rooms were generaly clean there were some places the cleaning staff obviously missed (between sofa and chair coushins, under the sink). The facilitys were all right. Unfortunatly the shower only dispenses cold or slightly warm water. The radiators only seemed to function randomly so the appartment was a little cold.   All these points didn't bother us too much, since we only stayed 3 days. We didn't mention any of this to the staff either. For a longer stay this might have been more of a problem."
"113","Hotel smart and tidy and well run. The pool is a added bonus and very clean and staff very helpfull.rayd"
"114","No view, surroundings are not very smart. No outside space for drinking and relaxing in the sunshine."
"115","Final tax de jour and parking added on booking out (30 Euros). This was not made clear early in booking process."
"116","The activities, food and hotel were amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The quality of the food and the choice was excellent. There was a great and amazing selection. The animation team were great! The room were spacious, the set up of the hotel was amazing..."
"117","The staff need to highlight the fact that the hotel is far away from the city center, there is a shuttle alright but it only brings to the Jmal Ef Fnaa place. The cost of taxi fare is 18eur a go. The hotel reception staff were friendly but not really professional. Each time we asked a question the information was uncertain or confused. We asked for room service and we had to wait 1h to get the food which arrived cold. We were told to be patient...as we rang twice to find out what was the status of the order, that was 45 min after we've ordered.... Also the cost of the food is expensive if you don't go all inclusive. The buffet cost needs be mentioned to guests when booking B"
"118","Beautiful hotel ,fab food and lovely staff"
"119","Fully deserves all its previous good reviews and more. Service was impeccable. General manager Andreas always around and very accessible and helpful.  Food very good and plenty of it, buffet menu had a different theme each night."
"120","No real negatives for us.  Some guests may not like the cats, there are a lot about the hotel."
"121","The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived and throughout our stay. The hotel was in a very peaceful location and had a lovely large swimming pool and outdoor cinema. The buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with a large selection of food to choose from."
"122","The hotel could have done with a variation of evening entertainment. It only had a couple of beach bars in walking distance no town near by so needed to hire a car or get a taxi. "

"129","Beware the prostitutes/pickpockets on the corner by buddies bar. They surrounded my friend and by the time he realised what was going on they had stolen his gold chain from around his neck. I know this is not the fault of the hotel but I would not stay there again for this reason."
"130","This hotel was very good considering the Price. I was very please with my comfy bed and the location.  Extremely quite and signs everywhere asking for quite after 11pm.   The restaurants were very reasonable and the Japanese restaurant was excellent.  The staff in fantastic. Young pleasant and full of fun. Loved there attitude. Went out of there  to make life easy. Exceptional. Thank you."
"131","I only have one and that goes for all hotels.   Wish there was rooms for a single traveler. We pay for two for everything.  I wonder if there is any  you can divide bedrooms so a bathroom can be shared by tow single.??"

"135","The overall presentation and location of the hotel was excellent.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The pools and slides were wonderful but crowded.  Shuttles were convenient and helpful.  "
"136","We were unimpressed by the on site restaurant choices and dined at other locations.  There were no late night food choices at the bar other than an over priced Round Table pizza that I would have had to wait until it was delivered from across the street.  There was a large gap at the bottom of our room door that we covered each evening with towels to keep the light and noise out.  We had late night noise issues outside of our room with loud music and talking on two out of our six night stay.  Staff addressed it when we made a call to the front desk. It would have been nicer if the slides were open for longer periods of time for our children to enjoy.  We had to go to another hotel to pickup and drop off our Dollar rental car. Hawaii's inflated prices for most everything drained our entertainment budget."
"137","Had booked hotel through hotelopia and had paperwork to show booking and payment. Arrived at 11:00 P.M. Staff on hand did not have anything indicating that I had payed and previously and would not accept my paperwork. They indicated to me that hotelopia had not sent them anything though I had a reservation but it showed it had not been payed. They asked for my card and said they would call Hotelopia to confirm my payment. When I checked out they had not called anyone and had charged me 52.00 for the nights stay. I told her the story from the night before and she could not confirm my payment either. So when we got home our records showed we had indeed payed for the room at time of booking with Hotelopia. So now we start the process to get my card credited. This is the   second time this has happened to us. Last time it was at Red Roof Inn. I would like to see these hotels be more diligent in there communications with these hotel sites to receive confirmation of payment as well as reservation."
"138","EXCELLENT!!! Beautiful immaculate hotel, they upgraded us to a 4 bedroom suite due to birthday from one of us,which was SPECTACULAR! Lots of attention and courtesy from all staff since we arrived till we left. This hotel is not your usual Ramada, this is a luxurious property in an excellent location on JBRWalk and Dubai Marina. and a block from beach. They gave us 3 free alcohol drinks vouchers at arrival! Will definitely stay here again and again! Hotelopia had the best nightly rate including half board that can't be beat by any hotel close by in this area in Dubai. Definitely a plus to include the excellent buffet bkfast/dinner, which by the  were tasty and a lot of variety well prepared delicious food. Short 10-15 minute walk to Jumeirah Lakesmetro station and gorgeous view of the Marina on the  to the metro station. Overall this hotel is excellent for the location, price, courteous staff and all the pampering since you arrive. Loved it and will definitely will return again."
"139","The only negative is that we were on a rental car and the drop off was at the hotel, which we can't find were the Dollar Car rental drop off was, and asked and they say inside the multilevel underground parking, but no signs or anything to direct you to Dollar Rent a Car, which after 20 minutes driving in circle inside the parking, I found out that is in front of the parking hotel entrance (no Dollar rent a car sign of any kind). and the car rental desk is inside the Ramada hotel. I guess this is not a Ramada hotel but the car rental to blame. I told the Dollar car rental representative about it, and he just said that everybody said the same thing! I told him well, you should put some signs or fix it for future travellers. He looked at me like he didn't care or any response at all. Other than this, this hotel is excellent! "
"140","The staff are so nice make you feel very welcome room ok only stop one night when traveling from france to Spain but have stopped 3 times now have just booked again"
"141","The new building were we stayed was very nice and clean. Close to the private beach.  The pool was superb, and also very clean.  Quiet surroundings made it a perfect place for a relaxing vacation."
"142","The variety of the buffet food could have been better.  Only one night a week with live dancing music was disapointing. ( Yes i know about the disco, but it was not appealing to others than teenagers.)  "
"143","GORGEOUS!!!  This is not your usual Holiday Inn hotel. Is fabulous!!! Excellent courteous attention since you arrive till you depart. Great soft sandy beach with Dead sea mud buckets for guests use. Great staff on front desk, golf carts, pools and beach. The views are SPECTACULAR! Such a peaceful and awesome place! The hotel pools are beautiful and so clean. The landscaping is beautiful as well. The drinks a little pricey but I guess that's everywhere on resorts like this in the area. Very Nice to have free complimentary soft drinks on the room fridge. We felt so welcome all the time and staff were super friendly all over the hotel. The room overlooked the pool and had a nice balcony with chairs and table. Bed was very comfortable and cold A/C. The breakfast buffet was simply AWESOME and TASTY!!! We didn't have dinner but had a delicious burger at the Chili Ways restaurant. Is like a fast food burger place, but better and delicious and not expensive. Just 5 minute up the hill from Holiday Inn hotel Dead Sea. Overall this hotel is great, sandy beach, sparkling pools, gorgeous views from rooms and the Dead Sea and is the first hotel on your right after check point on service road. Excellent hotel!"
"144","Pricey drinks but I guess that's all over Jordan with alcohol drinks. We had a glass of wine one evening by the pool and I can say that it didn't taste like a good quality wine, and they poured less than half the glass with wine.   Other than the drinks, the hotel is gorgeous and the best price/quality compared to nearby hotels."
"145","From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. The staff were so friendly, welcoming and helpful. I have stayed in 5 star hotels in London that were luxurious but the warm friendly atmosphere was nothing like what was present here. The spa was superb and the room fantastic the attention to detail and cleanliness second to none. As Arnie said ""I'll be back""!!!"
"146","the only thing that i think was negative was that we had to pay the parking and also the internet and these services weren't specified to  be paid on the hotel website!!"
"147","Time to renovation and renew all the furniture and bedding,it was to old and dirty."
"148","Location is great ski in "
"149","Great for families with young kids."
"150","Nothing about the hotel itself, but the Thomas cook reps/entertainment was too loud and constant."
"151","Our room was very spacious and comfortable. The hotel was situated in a good spot. We would have no quarms in recommending this hotel to friends and family."
"152","Staff have excellent manners. Very good scenery and decor, though it's quite old"
"153","The toilet door chipping at the bottom. The sink gets choked as the lever unable to push up the sink stopper. We had booked a taxi upon departure at 1.30pm at $30 to berjaya times square. A staff called us at 1pm to go down immediately saying its better we take this taxi which charges by meter. But in the end the taxi fare was $47 as it was six seater ,and it goes on highway all the  from the mines to berjaya times square. We felt cheated."
"154","very pleasant people, a large pool, direct output to the beach, clean rooms, no experience"
"155","Good location. Place was clean. Staff were friendly and helpful."
"156","The booking was with english breakfast but the hotel thought we were only entitled to continental.  They did give us the english breakfast once we proved it."
"157","Holiday too few feeder bus service, only one class.  Business hotel, did not provide sanitary products is hard to accept.  Poor sound insulation of the room! Result in poor sleep quality, sleep."
"158","Staff are all helpful, pleasant and friendly. We had a great expeience at breakfast room where they are so friendly and it made the start of the day very pleasant. Nicson james, faroq, alex, leonard, made extra effort to make us feel very welcomed! The staff from downstairs entrance always help us with our travel queries with good attitude and smiles. Something we rarely saw in UK."
"159","There should be a separate shower room rather than shower on bath. The tour company based on hotel (desert dream) is not good. We had very bad experience with desert safari with them. No air cond in car. Driver is not safe. 2 near miss accidents on highway. Tried to squeeze in as many people as possible in car with cheap rates once they got our booking earlier in week with high price and we ended up squezing in the very back of the car despite paying more than others. Hotel should consider whether they should give them a desk in lobby  and let them monopolize the guests when there are many tour companies out there."
"160","Orange juice a bit yukky at breakfast and was not over impressed with the reception staff but they were okay."
"161","Great location, nice sea terrace, lovely views from main hotel. "
"162","Some of the waiters/ bar staff had surley attitude. Appartments were not as pictured on internet. Limited evening entertainment. Ice creams for children not included during the day and prices inflated for purchase of goods and services in the hotel."

"164","Very good position, easy walking into the centre, near lovely parks and the river"

"167","The breakfast could be better."
"168","The staff were really helpful and friendly and the apartments are very well thought out, providing everything that you could need. "
"169","Some of the friendliest happiest staff I've come across in a hotel. Evening Entertainment needs improving to appeal to families. Children bored in the evening. Very good range of drinks on offer for both adults and children. Information missing on check in (booking of hotel bus, sports facilities, what the all inclusive program includes) would have benefitted from a more detailed information booklet. Would consider a future stay and would be encouraged by any repeat visitor offers/discounts. "
"170","Room not clean in arrival. Other peoples personal hair all over the bathroom. Made me uncomfortable in the room and I need to clean all the floors myself before I was happy to walk on them. Other than that, although basic the rooms were large and comfortable if a little cold in the evenings. The only negative I can think if is that the football pitch, an excellent facility and one of the reasons I booked the resort (my 14 yr old is football mad) was locked unless the entertainment team were present. A complete waste of an excellent facility which would keep teen boys occupied for most of the day."
"171","apartment was lovely clean was in good location very happy with my stay would return"
"172","prices for items inside the hotel too expensive. For example one espresso at the coffe shop 03.29 JOD"
"173","I only stayed the one night as I was in transit, however all interactions with staff were extremely postive. Requiring an international power adaptor was not am issue and even brought it to my room. From initially checking, breakfast through to helping with my bags and hailing a taxi.   Totally impressed and will be making every effort to choose the Hilton wherever I travel in future.    Please pass in my thanks to all staff in Singapore  Regards    Steve Meurs  Melbourne   Australia "

"175","Great location and food. Good sized rooms for central London. Very good value. Executive room had a large bed and a two seater sofa."
"176","We were given an executive room. The decor was a bit tired. However, we have stayed at this hotel previously and the standard room was in excellent condition. Air Conditioning didn't work very well in this room."
"177","Seriously awesome location up on the hills in Bodrum with great view of the city and sea. Lovely pool and staff. Great service. "
"178","Breakfast was great, with loads of choice...but the choice could have been a bit more varied each day, especially in relation to the hot food. Also, as you would expect from a place like this, drinks / food was a lot more expensive than one should reasonably pay - kinda put us off staying there to eat / drink much. On the other hand, it was great to go out in town instead."

"187","Great location - was much closer to the city centre than I realised from looking at the map. Also very close to the Shudehill tram exchange and bus station. Shudehill has a direct line to the Etihad Stadium which was great as we were staying for a concert at the stadium.  24 hours parking opposite the hotel at Total P carpark only £9 if you buy voucher from hotel.  I could see my car from our room.  Would definitely stay at hotel again for a few days break."

"190","This was our second visit and as on the first occasion we were very happy with most aspects.  Louisa (sorry about spelling) on reception was particulary knowledgable, efficient and very pleasant also."
"191","There was a large party of us and service at the catering facilities was very slow on each occasion as there was usually only one person doint all eg taking orders, serving, cooking and taking payments.  This resulted in us finally using outside facilities which we would rather not have done and I'm sure you would like to have received the business."

"199","3pm check in is quite late when flying overnight from Australia without sleep, suggest taking an extra night before so you can go straight to a room as we fell asleep in the lobby by 2pm and were awfully jetlagged - no fault of hotel, just a suggestion to flyers from down under.    Only negative comment is our room was corner room and whole of one side was entirely loover windows wind howled constantly through them when closed and road noise was very loud even though we were on floor second from top.  I wore ear plugs to get around this :-) "
"200","Internet - business centre unstisfactory.  Your access to internet via your computer is appalling.. This influenced my rating above for facilities.  I spent HOURS trying to get it working and your staff could nt get it working"

A little more information about the standard of the hotel would be good. Even the hotel's own website does not say everything, but it can be understood. So my recommendation is to not even check in. We left after some hours."
"254","Great location, 15 mins walk from the Duomo or a Metro right outside.  Worth trying the spa, currently two hours free for hotel guests, a lovely haven in the basement with sauna, steam, small pool and relaxing area. Would definetely stay here again when I return to Milan."

I needed to find solution and ask people around to give me password to connect to their private network which worked only... Last day when I was leaving I paid about 12 eur more because I didn' book through the web page that last day, and first day when I came they said don't worry, you don't need to book you will pay the same amount for room when you leave hotel.   ALSO SHUTTLE BUS WAS LATE ALL THE TIME AT LEAST 30 MIN, I MEAN WHAT'S THE POINT TO SAID HE WILL TO SAY THAT HE WILL COME EARLIER AND THEN PEOPLE ARE WAITING 30-40 MIN AT LEAST FOR NOTHING. "

My suite was spacious, had updated televisions, and attractive.      The location allows for walking to a variety of restaurants--ranging from fast food to moderately upscale restaurants.   The neighborhood is beautiful and surrounded by beautiful trees. It is only a few blocks from a fire station and siren-blaring trucks are frequent thought the night. "
"283","The closet  space was a bit sparse for a suite.  This was my mistake for not carefully checking the amenities before I booked this hotel--but there was no Spa or pool, which was a serious disappointment and oversight on my part. With no balcony or outside patio, I was confined to my room if I was at the hotel.  Again, a disappointment. "

No wi-fi or trouser press as advertised.Our room had 2 cut off water pipes sticking out of the floor. the door to the room had been damaged along the the hinge side and the paint was missing.

Sorry to be negative but I would not go back to this hotel.

The room was clean and tidy, it could have done with a hoovering, we were both tired from the night time flight so we didnt complain it was a small issue anyway.  The following morning we had this carried out by the hotel cleaner.  We asked for more pillows and  more tea bags they were delivered to our room very promptly.  The location of the Hotel was ideal only a few minutes driving time from Airport.    The transport to and from  airport and railway systems was excellant, staff very friendly and helpful in any questions that may have arisen about the area of Manchester.  "
"351","The design of the front reception, being set back quite a bit from front doors , and no signs above or below your staffs heads, that mentions the word reception, this would be more comprehensive and more friendly and appealing.  Thursday 31st of May 2013, I experienced a stomach migraine, I could not go for my breakfast, I said to my husband why dont u go on down for breakfast, he didnt want to go on his own.  There was no literature that stated that u could book breakfast to your room, as at the weekend , breakfast was served until 11.00 am.  The towels for bathing were very small, they were more like drying for your face and hands, than a full xxl size bath towel. "

"411","Well, we were kind of disappinted after we got there. The Hotel was built in 1926, which is great and was not the matter. But unfortunatly instead of keeping the old flair and restoring it to make it into a special place. Even if it went thru a restoration not to long ago, as the Hotel page says, I could not see it. Whe weired thing about the Hotel is, that there is 2 receptions. Obviously there is 2 different Hotels in one, which makes it really confusing if you try to book it, which we discovered too and did not find out about it until we arrived.  The Hotel is located just across the beach which is great and just above an old and run down mall which was probably the place to go in the 70th and 80th. unfortunatly that whole building is run down and not jaust that the whole Hollywood Boardwalk was run down and filthy. The beach is nice, nothing to say, but everything around it is not so nice. Just drive up north a south a bit and it""s much nicer. So we were glad just to sepend only one night in the Hotel. The rooms were ok. Not fancy, somewhat clean but alright.  We would not come back and we were kind of disappointed by the so highly recomended Hollywood Beach Boardwalk area."
"412","Very nice Riad/Hotel. We had a great experience. The manager was very competent and spoke several languages, including English, French, Spanish and Arabic. We can highly recommend this Riad. "
"413","The rooms were very clean. There was satellite-tv and all the rooms have a nice view on the ocean."
"414","The hotel is pretty far away from the centre of Havana. The breakfast is very mediocre and can't really be called continental if there's nothing to put on your sandwich. The swimmingpool is allright, but the foto's on the internet of the hotel were probably taken before the revolution, because nowadays the building looks ready for demolition. The cleaning-staff is very anoying, because every time you see them they come and ask you for things such as money, which almost makes you want to avoid them. "
"415","Excellent location, very polite and helpful staff. The negative comments below are only minor and I feel constructive and they would go no  put me off booking this hotel again"
"416","Would benefit from drinks facilities in the room.  Breakfast was quite poor considering it was served from a nearby restaurant having toast available would have enhanced the service."
"417","This was a truly fantastic Riad. The staff could not have done more for us. We were two young girls in our twenties and they helped organise everything for us. From tours, to taxis, to dinner and even brought us to some of the best places to get all our Moroccan beauty products. The Riad itself is beautiful. It is so clean and everything we imagined a Moroccan Riad to be. The breakfast was fabulous and we had dinner there one night too. The food was first class. I could not recommend this place any more, we had a great trip."

"421","Clean and central location. Staff were very accommodating given that we were leaving early on the day of departure. Great views and large balcony. We had everything we needed and therefore would happily use again (although upgrade to a bedroom if longer than the 4 night stay) Large pool although we didnt use it."
"422","Fridge was warm and very pointless! Slats continually fell out of the pull out sofa bed (a double bed in this space would be better suited as it would be more durable. Plus there is already a seating and table area!) Sofa was hard and uncomfortable but ok for such a short break. Deposit a bit steep for such a very basic room (and for a couple)! Not sure there is much to break worth 150 Euros."
"423","Very friendly and helpful staff"
"424","Lovely atmosphere and style, friendly and helpful staff. Room was a little small but comfortable and clean and certainly fine for a one night stay pre flight stay. Much prefer this hotel to the other more corporate style hotels on the airport and will definitely stay here again."
"425","I love the 24/7 shop :) and McDonalds is close :)"
"426","Nick named crap regancy, even tho I was a in-house guest I still had to pay entrance to the rest the facilities, the pool was always full with non-residedents, the sky bar sold no beer what so ever, I paid 250paso to go up there to a empty bar, no tiger like advertised, crap restaurant, if u buy anything you get suprised with hidden charges, elevators always full, loads of beggars outside and a dead dog"
"427","This hotel is situated in a quiet location in the village of Lapta, nestling between the sea and the mountains.  It's about 15 minutes' walk to the nearest public beach, which is small and sandy - likely to be crowded in summer.  Other beaches are accessible via a short car trip.  The keys to this hotel are the welcoming friendly family atmosphere - just the right amount for comfort, the informality, the excellent food - sourced locally, the lovely pool, and the garden - where everyone can find a corner to relax in their own .  Clean. It's a good centre, and a place to relax."
"428","As we experienced elsewhere in TR Cyprus, standards of maintenance are not the same as in the core countries of the EU.  It's quite hard to find, and if we had followed Google street map, we would have ended up in totally the wrong place. Make sure you get clear directions."
"429","arrived on a Saturday evening, was told no meals served after 7pm, but a coach load of Dutch were served a great looking meal after this time????  Had to decamp to local pub. It's a shame you lost out on our custom, we had been travelling all day and would have preferred to stay in."
"430","The staff are most courteous and helpful.  They make hotels guests feel welcome.    Parking facilities are more than ample and breakfast is good with long enough serving duration to please the late risers. The room is big enough without the feeling of claustrophobia.  The toilet is equally spacious and shower is good.  Normal hotel guests with reasonable expectations cannot ask for more."
"431","Bacon is absent on breakfast table.  Respecting religion, chicken bacon can be provided as in the East. Besides scrambled egg, eggs with sunny-side up would be another welcoming choice for many."
"432","Great hotel - modern spacious rooms, nicely fitted out - lots of very welcome freebies - free internet, free breakfast (delicious), free tea/coffee in room, free tea/coffee in lounge, free transport to/from airport, very professional and friendly staff. Nice view over park and golf-course from rooms at back. "
"433","Long journey by public transport into downtown - bus journey, then subway journey - but that's the same with all the Toronto airport hotels. (55 dollars by taxi. to downtown).  A receptionist misinformed me at one point - this caused me a problem - he should have checked out my query rather than give me a wrong answer."
"434","Well located as a cheaper alternative to New York which is only about 20 minutes away on the PATH train, 5 minutes from the hotel. Large rooms, reasonable breakfast, excellent and helpful staff."
"435","Needs updating as it looks a little tired. the area around the station isn't particularly nice in the evening with homeless/drinkers."
"436","I love this hotel, the staff are helpful, the location is fabulous for a relaxing break. This was my third visit and I am returning again in September."

"440","Modern high quality hotel in a good location. Short walk to pinxos bars and not far from the old town or Gugenhiem. Room was excellent - lovely bathroom and shower, great bed."
"441","The air con only seems to heat - it wouldn't cool. Could do with more staff on reception - when we checked in we had to wait nearly 15mins while the one staff member took a very long phone call, and on exit there was just one staff member on at peak check out time. But those are just minor issues - I would certainly still recommend staying here."
"442","Excellent all round performance by all staff. Enjoyed a couple of outstanding meals in the restaurant. Staff member Thai Becker was especially helpful with local knowledge."
"443"," If u want to ease and relax then u will have a phantastic place to go. There were more spanish and old couples. No Party People."
"444","Not that much Entertainment for Kids, not the big variety of fruits could be more. The big pool is not heated was not ideally for my little daughter to swim."
"445","Clean, good staff and good food"
"446","TV didn't work and as we were on route to Holyhead we just wanted to relax with some entertainment in the room.  As radios do not appear in rooms we were disappointed and no compensation was offered."

Though the hotel deco and interior seem to be luxurious and some staffs were kind and thoughtful, many staffs(reception, restaurants etc) were lazy, surly and never friendly. There is even no doorman at this hotel! They should learn to smile and deal with customers' requests more professionally and quickly! Almost all facilities seem to be too old and there were so many mosquitos in my room. And the price of food is exorbitantly expensive!  "
"451","The poolbar has been facilitated by Spiro Kulla and Lambrini Zitsi. They ware very nice, and the food was very good and fresh every day.  It was a pleasure to meet them!"

"454","I will do a more detailed Facebook review but thought the hotel and rooms were very modern and clean and of a pretty decent size. Giant size bath-tub and housekeeping staff were very friendly. :-)    Great to be able to have an extra bed     Nice decor - good lighting, large TV"
"455","A little far out of town  Bad wi-fi connection inside the room (only picked it up in the hallway)  The front desk staff - I had such problems when I called up to find anyone who spoke good enough English (and I spoke to about 4 or 5 diff people. One lady told me it was a 20 minute taxi cab ride from the Eurostar station!!!!!)  And recommendations were very hit and miss - there is no dedicated concierge and everyone just recommended Barbue d'Anvers and other just recommended the restaurants along rue de Rihour and other touristy places. Sometimes someone would suggest rue de la Monnaie or Gand but not actually give specific restaurant recommendations. (There were one or two staff who at least brought out the book of recommendations that u have but the rest were very poor and that was the biggest let down, given that you are a 5* establishment.  There were no porters or taxis outside the hotel  The spa and gym were very new but small and just felt like they had been added to check the box"

I am presently trying my hardest to recover my money. I believe Hotelopia is a dodgy and/or incompetent agency."

We pointed this out to the management and they then showed us the Superior which smelled and had ripped and dirty carpets. We stayed in the room given. It was disappointing and not what we expected. "
"466","Our bedroom leaked when it rained, all of our clothes were wet as were our cases. We advised reception and were given another key no-one was interested in helping us. The new room had a puddle of water in the middle of the room. Another couple had water coming down through the light fittings. We left after two nights. No offer of refund for the third night was made."
"467","distance to disneyland"
"468","towels were like sand paper and definitely I mean sandpaper have never had them so bad"
"469","Only the distance to Disney "
"470","The carpet is filthy we have to use the towels to walk in the room because is nasty and the room is very small for 4 people  And the girls  on the lobby  are almost  indiferent  to you  very  unfriendly  customer  service. So bad and sad  won't  come  back ...."
"471","The Hotel is in a great location and the rooms facing the river Clyde are very peaceful, and  hearing the river is quite calming.  The rooms are well furnished and our beds were very comfortable.  "
"472","Fantastic value and the staff were excellent. I will be re-booking without a shadow of a doubt, As I was unable to walk very well, and use a stick the bar staff were very helpful at carrying my drinks to the poolside "
"473","Pity about the road works, which are beyond the control of the hotel, but it must detract passing tourists from staying the night as they are unaware of the noise levels from the works.  Also why is there no toothbrush holder by the washand basin in the bathroom, nor tumbler for drinking water or the taking of tablets, when asked the staff did supply one ?  The breakfast was boring - but typical of the Algarve Hotels."
"474","There was a nice pool.  TV service was OK.  Receptionist were well informed about local traffic and attractions."
"475","Premium WIFI couldn't be applicable on our devices.  Free WIFI was extremely slow.  The view of the room was a white wall.  When the window were open it was too noisy: kitchen located to the neighbor building.  It was noisy even with closed windows: construction noises from a close apartment from the same hotel.  The walls were so thin that we could even hear others having showers, going somewhere.  DJ and singers had performances in the hotel during the evenings which could be listened even in the rooms making us unable to go to bed before 10/11 pm.  In the dinner we had to pay for even juices, teas or water."
"476","Booked a compact room - was expecting a very small box room - this was not the case at all.  We were given room 301.  Not a massive room, but has a window (booking confirmation said there was no window) and is ample space for two people.  Ironing board/iron, coffee machine, kettle and TV all in the room.  Clean.  Much better than a Travelodge!"
"477","Bathroom very small (but this was a compact room!).  Reception not staffed in the morning until 8am and as we need to leave at 7am there was no one to leave the room key with.  But this would not stop us from staying again."
"478","In the center of down town "
"479","There is no restaurant to serve breakfast in the hotel if booking room with breakfast u have to other hotel nearby to your breakfast !!  I suggest to prepare the roof to service breakfast in the hotel . "
"480","It was soooo nice to stay in an old hotel so well kept. Clean, spacious and very nice people working there. "
"481","No air conditioning. We were lucky enough to enjoy a very nice hot day with a very hot white night. You may not be that lucky :P"
"482","Excellent staff and quality of the food was toppppp"
"483","Great location. Good breakfast."
"484","Room could have been cleaner.  "
"485","Spa area not very clean, Traffic noise in some rooms."
"486","No problems excellent hotel.  One exception waiting to move into room after long flight.  Should be able to use room once arrived on account of exhaustion one experiences after long plane journey  .,"
"487","Heart of down town , friendly staff , this hotel service for you more than what you  pay for it   "
"488","Hard to get location ."
"489","My fiancé and I had such a WONDERFUL time at this resort! We spent most of our time by the pool and I can't emphasize how lovely it was. There were a total of 3 salt water outdoor pools, a private sand beach, and a small rocky alcove in which you could jump in and swim in the sea. All of the locations had PLENTY of sun beds so we never felt crowded and were always able to find the perfect spot to catch some sun. Our stay was at the beginning of the high season, June 3rd-7th.     We did not purchase the all inclusive package but were very pleased with the food at the resort that we ate most of our meals there. We did, however, have breakfast included in our board and thought the buffet was absolutely excellent. The lunch service next to the main pool was good overall, although a little pricey. I enjoyed the crispy chicken wrap with salad which was approximately 10 euros not including french fries. For dinner we only ate at the resort once and made a reservation at Alang Alang which was absolutely perfect! My fiancé and I had bruschetta starters and the steak fillet for our main course and the chocolate and hazelnut tart for dessert and we had no complaints throughout the entire meal! We ate dinner at the nearby Riviera Resort one evening and found that the Alang Alang restaurant was MUCH better quality for the money and the atmosphere was one in a million with the beautiful outdoor sea view. I will say though, on windy evenings the location may not be the best but we were lucky enough to have the perfect weather.     The room was exactly what we expected. There were two twin beds which we ended up pushing together, a small TV, a mini fridge, full bath, and a balcony. We had a decent view... 1/3 of which overlooked the sea, 1/3 a private patio beneath and 1/3 the rooftop. The room was clean and spacious, the shower leaked a bit from the faucet but didn't bother us at all. Air conditioning didn't seem to keep the room too cool but keeping the balcony door open with the curtains closed did the trick at night. "
"490","The resort photographers were pretty pushy. If people rejected their services they would still try and entice them to have their pictures taken. My fiancé and I didn't especially mind them but noticed some that did. "

"499","A DVD player in the room would be nice."
"500","Great looking....good position......good staff"
"501","Food left a lot to be desired"
"502","Hotel very well situated for the Llamberris attractions. Our first room was clean and tidy but faced into courtyard.  We moved next day to our requested mountain view. This was a very large room with seating.The staff are friendly and helpfull. The Hotel restaurant is good value and worth considering as eating in Llanberris is limited and London  prices for not much choice. Would use this hotel again if coming to this area.    "
"503","This Hotel has seen better days and is in need of some TLC to return it to it's former glory. Do not let this put you off  unless you want 4* flunky service. You can get some good deals via hotel booking sites and pay a lot more in town  without the grounds and location."
"504","Very good personal attention  Nice and confortable room"
"505","From start to leaving we were impressed with this beautiful hotel, the bedroom was exquisite and the food was excellent. All members of staff were kind thoughtful and attentive to all our needs the facilities and cleanliness were superb.Excellent value for the money.  Look forward to returning in 2014."
"506","Nice and efficient"
"507","We had problems with the shower mecanism    It was not that easy to see the hotel, we came walking from Airport"
"508","great! constant calls from manager inquiring about our stay etc. clean rooms, had WI FI etc. IPod dock etc. good resort, eg. pools etc. friendly staff, felt welcomed here, good service. walking distance to the Marina and nightlife eateries etc. Staff at entrance took care of us very well,  by taking the taxi number and gave cards in case we got lost, specialy in a strange country. "
"509","In a good 10 minute walk from London eye. Easy to find and out of the busiest areas"
"510","Hotel does get a lot of noise of emergency vehicles going past."
"511","Stayed in this hotel many times perfect location and great value for money. Already recommended to many friends and family"
"512","Please, please provide tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms, then they would be perfect!!"
"513","The staff at check in was courteous. "
"514","Hotel now quite shabby.  Cut backs - no paper hankies!   Food could be better.  Ran out of fried eggs on Saturday morning, they were not replenished."
"515","The hotell and hotell area were nice.    "
"516","The furniture in the rooms were old and ugly, the bed were stone hard.   And the Music from the night clubs outside the hotell was hurrible! You could hear it all night!"
"517","Good location about 15 mins walk from cruise harbour / main market. Room size is good and superb Pool "
"518","Missing are basic amenities such as iron board, steam iron (on call), electric kettle in the room to make tea / coffee, dental /shaving kits in bathroom which are kind of standard items in most 5 stars across the globe."
"519","Free WIFI, staff pleasant, location good for Paddington. Towels in the bathroom were good quality. Breakfast waitresses were very nice and food choice was ok. The reception manager did his best to offer me a room change but the hotel was full."
"520","My room was in the basement and was supposed to be a 'renovated' room. It still looked very tired and the curtain was hanging off the rail. The small wardrobe was crammed with spare duvet and blanket, making it unusable, I didn't unpack my case as a result. The noise from the road outside kept me awake most of the night - not helpful when you are working."
"521","Reasonable size room for a city hotel - bed comfortable. Bathroom very small, but shower was excellant! Only about 5 mins walk from Termini station - but still a reasonably quiet location. Good base for walking round the city"
"522","Could not fault the hotel. Clean, modern, helpful friendly staff, good selection of food at breakfast and to top it all excellent value in comparison to other hotels in area. Would definitely pay a return visit."
"523","Ideal situated with in the midle of modern Fez.  next to the trainstation with perfect swimmingpool, petit taxi takes you to de medina (souks)  within 10 min. for 10 dirham. "
"524","Extremely noisy! We cannot even reach to the beach, construction everywhere.. The worst hotel we've ever been. Stay away from this place!!!"
"525","Friendly and helpful staff, willing to help e.g. we wanted to change the room and we got better one without additional charge, they let us to keep our stuff in the room till 3pm etc.   Good and pleasant bar and breakfast service. Good breakfast. Swimming pool is cleansed on daily basis. Hotel management is currently fixing all minor technical and decorative faults.Good daily room cleaning. Good distance from hustle and bustle of Tangier which is easily accessible by Petit Taxi (15-20 Dirhams = £1 – £1.5). Hotel interior and exterior is reasonably clean.   I was satisfied price and service.  "
"526","In need of: some decorative work, better lift, fixing some door handles, sound insulation of water pump for swimming pool - noise can be heard in some rooms (our reason to change the room), cleaners frequently forget to put fresh towels in the room after they have removed the old ones (ask them/remind them and they will be happy to put them in your room). Important: Hotel usually provides only two towels and it is advisable to bring couple of your own!  But, that’s Moroccan (a bit sloppy) ‘way’ and if you are annoyed by that, I suggest – choose five star hotel. Everything has its price.   "
"527","Location is nice. The room was spacious. The food was good."
"528","The staff response was terrible, room supplies were not complete.  We were under the impression that the internet is free but were surprised with the cost for both internet and phone calls ( ~ times the normal price per minute)"
"529","Exceptionally helpful staff  Very close to attractions  Exceptional value for money  Would definitely recommend to family and friends"
"530","None noted - a very positive experience"
"531","Our stay was very pleasant and very comfortable and we found your staff to be very friendly and accommodating"
"532","I was very annoyed at the charge of a local call I made from the hotel.  This was daylight robbery to say the least and you should not be allowed to charge these exorbitant rates - it's outrageous!!"
"533","I spent a pleasant one week holiday at Ersan Resort "
"534","The only negative feedback we have to complain about were all the UK kids playing around with green lazers, which should be completely prohibited in the hotel area as they can be harmful to your eyes."
"535","very happy when we arrived at the hotel, we had a three bedroomed suite that was very big and the ensuite bathroom was very nice in master bedroom. modern kitchen with full use of all amenities, very handy with washing machine and tumble dryer meant for once we went home with clean clothes. the kids loved the pirate pool and made full use of the gym. on site shop very expensive but that to be expected and seeing as there are plenty of supermarkets close by this is no real problem, food and drinks very good in irish pub and with the shopping complex next door, we always had something to do. overall a great hotel for families and I will certainly book again when I visit Florida next."
"536","We were delighted with the level of service from arrival till departure - a world class hotel on our doorstep which I think many of our locals are  unaware of."
"537","Bit surprised to discover that after we had paid our accommodation and booked for our curry buffet dinner that there  was a cheaper package available that included all that and a treatment in the spa.  Also guests should maybe be warned about monkeys which are able to get into the rooms and cause a bit of havoc."
"538","Excellent, personal service. Staff were pleasant and went out of their  to help in any  they could."
"539","The room was good,location ideal for lively night life,that is if you dont mind the noise late at night."
"540","All but one off the desk staff were unfriendly,unhelpfull to the point of being downright rude.We had to pay daily for the use of sunbeds,which there were very few off,there was no option of a late checkout ""which we would have greatfully paid for""there was also no option of  a courtesy room or anywhere to properly wash before leaving.Love Benelmadana but would never go back to the Alay apartments nor recomend it to anyone else."
"541","- Not possible to see the sunset  - Ocean in from of the Bamboo Hut (BB2) was dirty (plastic bags, bottles, ...)    - Waste water of the shower and sink flowes into the ocean   - Many pieces of broken glass could be found at the entrance of the ocean right in front of BB2  - Some of the bamboo rails are loss and partly splintered (danger of injury!)  - Partly disturbing noise of the ferries and passing long boats  - Not suitable for kids"
"542","Had Dinner at this hotel, food awful too much Indian spices on every thing. Need to change chef and menu"
"543","Staff very friendly, brilliant location."
"544","Rooms are in need of major refurbishment to keep up to date with the rest of the hotel, cost of overnight parking should be included in the price of the room, tv in the room didn't have a good signal, blood stains on the bed, mirror in the bathroom broken, cleaners making noise in the corridors too early in the morning, mini in the room not filled up at all, not enough plug sockets in the room."
"545","The decoration and room was great, they have a good Swimming pool, and  one can near get a bus to Bodrum and the surrondings for 4.75 liras. "
"546","The girl at the reception was nice, but she showed me just the room to inform me that the air conditioning was broken and if I wish an additional, I have to pay. The reception is closed during the night, but it is a phone number to call in case of eed information.    The breakfast was just a plate with cheese, bread, butter, olives... Coffee or tea."

Decent breakfast buffet included, as was WiFi throughout. Hotel also has restaurant if needed. Good location in quiet, safe area. 3 minutes walk from Lepanto Metro (maybe 5 with a suitcase). 15-20 minutes to St Peters/Vatican. 15 minutes will get you across the river to either Piazza del Popolo or Piazza Navona. Very good value."

"721","This hotel seems to have placed all of its effort into looking funky, modern and stylish, and lost sight of its main aim: to provide a comfortable night's sleep, a good breakfast, and to make the guests feel welcome and valued. :(    Arrival from Prince Regent DLR station was confusing, as it brings you out on a higher level than the Reception Desk. Signage to the Reception Desk is missing, and left us floundering for an entrance for a bit.    Upon locating Reception, of the two staff on duty, One was busy assisting a customer with a lost(!) booking (didn't bode well), and the other just completely ignored us! So we tried the auto check in computer system, which froze up, and was useless. So we waited. And waited.... We absorbed the acrid smell of chlorine presumably coming from the swimming pool which we couldn't see. And we waited...in the heat...(turn the air con on in Reception, please!) And waited...    Eventually we got our room.     The large front facing windows  the car park immediately raised the issue of lack of privacy. In order to not be looked in at, it was necessary to close the blackout blinds, but then, having lost broad daylight outside, we were plunged into gloom by the inadequate bedroom lighting.    Don't choose this hotel if you want room service - that is not on offer. Oh and the alarm clock was stuck at 6pm - despite the real time, and there was no (obvious)  to correct it. Thank goodness my mobile phone had an alarm on it.    It did contain a hairdryer. (It would have been nice if the website had confirmed that - save me dragging one with me in my luggage).    The worst thing was the pillows. Thin, foam, pillows that squashed utterly flat when you put your head on them, you might as well sleep without a pillow for all the support they provided. I got bad neck ache.    The second worst thing is breakfast, Advertised as ""continental"", I expected croissants, bread, cheese, meats, cereal, yoghurt and fruit. Basically, a reasonable savoury option, as well as sweet (which I don't eat). But I struggled to find anything suitable, and ended up with the only option on the menu: bagel and cream cheese. Additionally, the breakfast was confusing. You get a choice of any three items plus a hot drink, but some things (e.g. butter, jam, sauces, etc.) do not count as ""items"" - but that was not clear. And again, staff were slow to respond to their confused customers. I seriously suggest there is a training issue here! My husband doesn't drink hot drinks, and felt discriminated against as he had to use one of his ""items"" to pick a fruit juice.    Lastly: check out. We tried to use the computer check out system, but that wanted to charge us £1 to check out!! Confused (as we hadn't bought anything for a pound, and the room was already paid for), we went to the desk to be told grudgingly that the £1 was a ""suggested donation"". WHAT?? A donation to what? Who? Why? It was just listed as a charge on the computer. The receptionist said she would remove it from our bill if we didn't want to pay it. Talk about hidden charges!    Shame. The place is brilliantly located, and lovely in terms of décor. But they really need to review it through the eyes of their customers.  "

The ceiling in our bathroom fell in on our last day there as the work for the re-modelling was taking place on the floor above us from 8am that morning.  I immediately made a complaint to the management  who have said they will be contacting you regarding a refund for our stay.  I have tried calling your customer service  line today but it's engaged.  I would appreciate acknowledgement that you have received this complaint and will be dealing with the re-fund when you hear from the Hotel Management. My email is carol.orr@trintech.com  my phone number is 0y7932 674540. I was extremely disappointed with this hotel, it had a very musty smell about it, the decoration was dirty and torn in places.

The hotel organized tours, were helpful with queries and were warm and professional. The rooms were thoroughly cleaned out everyday.  The clean spacious pool has a"" built in  sunken bar area"" and the ample gardens are very pretty, treed and have a small play area.   The airconditioned rooms had comfortable spacious beds and fridge, coffee , tea, kettle, television and Wifi access. The patio proved to be invaluable spot to put out all our surf gear, wet towels etc.     Overall - it was the best deal we found on the web and my kids who never normally like the beach got right into it as it was right on our doorstep...They even learnt to surf!  For those who like to be ""seen"" the upmarket Cocoon bar/restaurant is a 5 minute stroll away!     "
"780","The first 3 nights were very peaceful  but the last 4 were spoilt a bit by an intake of very noisy group of people who took up 3 rooms next to and opposite us - my husband and I did not complain but I am sure the hotel would have moved us to another room if we had.      Suggestions to hotel : Breakfast was ample but it would have been nice  to provide an even greater variety of your  local fruits in the morning and had a few more breakfast cereal choices (such as muesli etc ) and  offered flavoured yogurts for kids. Changing the breakfast choices a little bit more each day would be awesome!!  The combined bath/shower was handy but the bath too small for an adult to lie back in...the bath towels, though obviously a good quality and clean, could do with replacing.  The pool noodles could do with replacing and providing a trampoline for kids  and/or an outdoor chess paved area  would make this an even more versatile and family friendly hotel."
"781","Situated right on the beach and behind the best priced ""on the beach restaurant ""- ""Champlung"" - the facilities, hospitality and awesome location made this a memorable holiday for us and our 2 boys. The hotel organized tours, were helpful with queries and were warm and professional. The rooms were thoroughly cleaned out everyday.  The clean spacious pool has a"" built in  sunken bar area"" and the ample gardens are very pretty, treed and have a small play area.   The airconditioned rooms had comfortable spacious beds and fridge, coffee , tea, kettle, television and Wifi access. The patio proved to be invaluable spot to put out all our surf gear, wet towels etc.     Overall - it was the best deal we found on the web and my kids who never normally like the beach got right into it as it was right on our doorstep...They even learnt to surf!  For those who like to be ""seen"" the upmarket Cocoon bar/restaurant is a 5 minute stroll away!     "
"782","The first 3 nights were very peaceful  but the last 4 were spoilt a bit by an intake of very noisy group of people who took up 3 rooms next to and opposite us - my husband and I did not complain but I am sure the hotel would have moved us to another room if we had.

"783","Very friendly and helpful staff, nice big rooms, bed was very comfortable, everything as per description. "
"784","Room could have been cleaner"
"785","The staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Facilities and food were fantastic. No limits on the drinks, including branded spirits. Gym was also well equipped if you needed some exercise to build up your appetite for the next meal on offer! Loved the water taxi that took you to the other hotels in the group."
"786","Minor niggle that the bathroom could do with modernising and there were several large groups at the hotel whilst we were staying, so would not be the right environment for a cosy, intimate  holiday. Our room was close to the evening activity which continued til 10.30 which may be a problem for those with younger children. Ask for a room further away."
"787","Perfect room, perfect price and perfect service. The South African lady on front desk was the most polite person I've dealt with in along time. Class act and hotel.. Would highly recommend "
"788","They were very helpful with everything we needed. "
"789","The only drawback is that it{s in an older part of towm. Don{t wander around after dark."
"790","Microwave in the villa did not work  Bedding was of the quality of a three-star hotel  Bathroom faucets were broken  Overall quality of the villa was poor even though it was spacious; for that quality, it was ridiculously over-priced  There was a charge for everything;even the shuttle to the shopping area, which is a complementary service at most hotels"
"791","could not fault the facilities at the hotel, coffee available 24/7, afternoon snacks and lemonade provided and the breakfast had enough choice for anyone. reception staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times. We travelled a long  to stay for the CMA fest and would definately choose this hotel again. Location to downtown was reasonable walking distance but for the less mobile a shuttle bus goes back and forth downtown e. "
"792","location is excellent, the service is first class"

"804","Room service was excellent and all staff were very kind.  Food was excellent. Very relaxing.  One could stay a week without having to travel outside the grounds."
"805","The beds were very uncomfortable...very hard and noisy at the slightest move.  We could hear everything in the room next door eg. television, toilet flushing, voices and every time they moved in their beds."
"806","My husband and I had four wonderful days  at Finca de son Palou. The hotel is  beautiful with a special charming athmosphere, the staff very nice, friendly, helpfull and ptofessional, fantastic food,beautiful surroundings, extremely quiet - you only hear a sheep now and then and birds singing all day long. We enjoyed every minut of our stay."
"807","Great hotel perfect size . The hotel was full but didn't feel over crowded. Very modern pool area with great facilities including a children's pool, normal pool and a hydro contact area. Great value for money and the Customer service pays a large part of the hotels attraction "
"808","The Balcony area on our room wasn't very generous and felt a bit secluded facing the kitchens .and never really got much sun,  however the apartment it's self was a generous size "
"809","The roof bar was a very pleasant area where we were able to have a drink in the summer sun - although I'm not sure where thats gone now!!"
"810","Moved hotels as over booked. Wasn't asked was told. Always use this hotel. Terrible communication with hotel staff. Complained several times.   Other hotel is part and was called caribbeanBay. Lack of all facilities. I have 5 days booked in Oct and hope I don't experience the same again.  I probably won't use this hotel after this unless there is dramatic changes. Also I won't reccomend this hotel to others as don't want them to be disappointed.   PalmaBay complex on the other hand is FAB. Close to everything and good value for money.   Disappointed to have been told its because I only stay for 2/3 days a time. (At least every 6 weeks I visit mind you).  Food in main complex is fine along with the bar. Very friendly along with the entertainment team. "
"811","Very welcoming atmosphere. Staff on reception and bar should be commended for their friendliness and helpful approach"
"812","very good 2nd stay in 2 months. Intend to go back in autumn"
"813","hotel should consider loyalty awards for frequent visitors"
"814","Restaurant food - both chose fish all of which tasteless, wines we chose not available.  Plastic cups for hot drinks in room - odd when real glasses provided for water."
"815","Very well located in the old quarter opposite the museum with short walk to metro and ferries to souks. Staff gave good advice on tourist activities and were very friendly. Shower was excellent!"
"816","Room air conditioning a little noisey and did not respond to control console. Wi- fi reception variable."
"817","Having stayed at the accommodation previously I can with no doubt say that the exceptional standard of cleanliness comfort and customer care is being maintained   "
"818","Staff very pleasant and helpful.  Room immaculate.  Excellent location."
"819","Should have all inclusive breakfast and wifi and use of unmanned facilities eg pool."
"820","Excellent service throughout our stay from all the staff who were always polite and very informative. Lovely large room and bathroom, spotlessly clean with everything you needed. This was our start for a tour of Spain and it set us off in a very happy mood which made all the difference. Great location in the city within walking distance of many shops, bars/restaurants and lovely tapas bars. We loved Santander and the Silken Coliseum and will definitely return again soon."
"821","Beautiful resort, professional and social staff who speaks good English, stunning beach, comfortable rooms, always warm water, tasty drinks, popular club on the premises with free entry for guests.     It is kind of neat that they have different color arm-bands depending on where you're from, blue for Europe, red for USA, green for Canada."
"822","The food is varied with some things being great and others not, showering in our room left a puddle of water on the floor, salesmen at the resort make it hard to completely relax but will be good for your self esteem because they will tell you you're beautiful, the system for WiFi is unpractical and expensive - we went outside the resort and found free WiFi for quickly checking our emails, so no one should expect to be connected while at the resort unless willing to pay too much for it."
"823","very basic, small rooms"
"824","The room was very nice for the price. Nice view and very close to the city center. "
"825","Good price, good food, room oke and also outside everything allright."
"826","loved everything about the hotel, the food was great, the best by far i've had in any of the dominican republic. the pools were lovely and everywhere was clean, i dont really have any complaints about the hotel"
"827","Lower level felt muggy humid and the fan provided didn't really help"
"828","Didn't find anything positive about the hotel. "
"829","Not a very good location.   Stinky lobby and rooms. Filthy bathroom.   Toilet flush not working properly. Poor quality soap provided.   Fresh towels were stinking. Always had to wait atleast 10 mins to be served at the front desk.   Reception would never answer your phone. Ordered pasta which was not good at all.   Hotel staff said they do complimentary airport drop offs but when asked said no we don't you will have to find your taxi.   Staff not very knowledgeable, asked if train goes to the airport and they said no only taxi however train goes directly to the terminals.   Very disappointed. Had worst stay at citrus. "
"830","I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!  Bar shut at 10.30pm.  Morning paper ordered but none available.  Breakfast not available on first morning as we were told we were too late 9.10 am we were told 9.30 am finish. Breakfast on second morning was disgusting - bacon so crispy could not be cut.  Beans must have been in pan all the previous week.  Tomatoes not cooked and extremely hard.    Noise from air conditioning unit kept me awake nearly all night.    Our stay was Sunday 9th and Monday 10th June.    We stayed at the Best Western Weston Hall Hotel in Bulkington on Saturday 8th June and this was FIRST CLASS.    I was told by friends that the Best Western in Northampton was being closed.  THE SOONER THE BETTER.    "
"831","very pleased especially for the price! The males at teh desk were nicer than the females and all of the employees from the maids to the repairmen to the food servers were super nice!"
"832","they had to close the hot tub twice and the man at the desk when i called told me if I let them know by monday at noon that i wanted to check out a day early I wouldnt be charged and when I went to tell them at the front desk that I wanted to check out on Tuesday inseatd of Wednesday i was told i still had to pay for that night.  i did check out on Tuesday as opposed to Wednesday  the reason I had to check out early was due to a death in the family.  "
"833","The Holiday Inn Express on broadway in Nashville is in a great location - an easy walk from the downtown area but just far enough away from the hustle and bustle to be peaceful. Staff were all fantastic, rooms were good without being great, and the facilities covered pretty much everything you'd expect from a normal hotel (except a bar)! Breakfast was fresh and plentiful, every request was fulfilled without any fuss, and the compilmentary wifi was a real bonus. An all round great experience. "
"834","good location, The rooms is new and clean.My family "
"835","Cool hotel, quirky rooms. AC in rooms and looked clean. "
"836","shower/wet room. When the shower is on the whole room is under water, shower, sink, toilet and bin! Took 2 hours to fully drain and even then the floor was wet which was annoying if wanted to use the sink or toilet."
"837","Nothing. This was the first time I paid for 3 persons and turns out you still have to pay again for an extra bed. I am guessing the Triple Rate only entitles a third person to breath in the air and no place to sleep."
"838","This was the first time I paid for 3 persons and turns out you still have to pay again for an extra bed. I am guessing the Triple Rate only entitles a third person to breath in the air and no place to sleep. Despite clearly stating the occupancy as three adults, and paying a higher rate, the hotel did not provide an extra bed. They charged us by force, i.e refusing to let us check in if we did not pay for an extra bed.    "
"839","just perfect ,  top friendly staff.well done to all at hotel."
"840","nothing negative to say about hotel."
"841","Good location with two metro lines nearby.  Pleasant staff."
"842","The hotel bill was not properly done.  Taxes on lunch were calculated double."
"843","Great, great staff at Hotel Fiume. Our booking managed to get lost in translation (not sure if it was booking agency or hotel who were responsible) but staff at Hotel Fiume could not have been more helpful. We were given a room in another lovely hotel nearby with all arrangements made for us and transport organized. We then came back to the lovely Hotel Fiume for the rest of our stay. Comfortable, lovely and clean and a great breakfast to start us off on our days of exploring Rome."
"844","Nothing negative to say. Great stay."
"845","Good location - close to beach, transport and town"
"846","Overall a lovely place to stay, although take brolly if walking to tram station, which is around corner "
"847","Unfortunately we had some VERY loud "
"848","Kind staff at reception"
"849","Cleaning was so and so, staff "
"850","Very pleased with the hotel and its close location to the Hbf "
"851","The quality of this lovely hotel is 5 star in all ways.  Staff are smiling helpful and clearly aiming to please and eliminate any initial small teething problems.  The restaurant clearly uses high quality ingredients.    Not a criticism but an opinion, The restaurants are beautifully modern and functional, perfect for families, however less appropriate for couples who want an adult atmosphere and intimacy at dinner.   "
"852","I have stayed at the Coconut before and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The staff are friendly, the rooms are small but very clean.  Its only a 5min walk to the beach, the pink line is 2min away, there is an ABC store on the corner for drinks, snacks etc.  Its the perfect hotel but remember it is a hotel not a resort - so the pool is small, the rooms are small but its exceptional in every other manner."
"853","Location is awesome, the hotel has everything you need if you cannot find it onsite it is close by. Being on the beach was great having cocktails by the water another perk. The food at the cafe on site was great and Starbucks is here my kids loved that. "
"854","Gaya has a very nice pool, but it's a pity that the sun isnt there in the afternoon."
"855","When we booked back in dec they were renovating the pool due to be finished in may,however still under major reconstruction, so we only had access to a makeshift pool!  Very disappointing "
"856","Central location. Very helpful proprioters ."
"857","We were lucky to chose this hotel. The hotel location is perfect. If you do not want to pay $25 for valet parking. A public parking for $15 per day ( free in and out) just next door. You can walk to beautiful shopping center and market place and the beach. We got the early check in at 11:00am instead of 3:00pm. The breakfarst are very nice, not luxory but you get everything you need. Also they provide afternoon refreshment which is a very good suprise. The room is well presented and clean. Stuff are super friendly. Our kids enjoyed the swimming pool very much. The 24/7 restaurant is so convenient when you don't want to go out eating. We had wonderful 5 nights there. "
"858","Lovely hotel with a fab location "
"859","Everything was positive except"
"860","1 negative review.    When we checked in we were offered a river view room for an extra payment per night (£30 instead of £50) which we declined.  When we got to our room we had a river view room anyway which was lovely, but I do wonder what I would have paid an extra £30 per night for if I'd said yes to a River View.  "
"861","The hotel staff was great, we had trouble finding a parking spot in the car park and they helped us to find one outside, the staff at the reception desk was very nice and friendly, I forgot to bring my own plug adapter for my electric toothbrush and they happily found one for me. The room itself and the bed was comfortable and clean."
"862","The bathroom is generally quite run down, the wash basin was moslty cracked and the cracks have turned black which I thought should be replaced for hygiene purpose. Some tiles in the shower area was the same. The shower was very very weak no matter haw far you turned the taps. However, i was very disgusted with the towels. Nearly every towel had hair on it, long ones, short ones, and they are not mine as I haven't even used them. I almost thought that it was used to wipe the floor and folded back up and left on the bench."
"863","We enjoyed our stay. The hotel was handy for the shops and the Pavilion and its gardens. As it was adjacent to the Dome we  were able to enjoy the Spa and not have far to go given the weather. On another occasion we would attempt to organize ourselves better to enjoy all the facilities the hotel and Buxton have to offer, including the Opera House. Given the inclement weather we appreciated the warmth in our rooms and the fact we had booked an evening meal, also that we could sit in comfort in the bar with  our coffee and drinks."
"864","Great landscape, nice lobby, friendly staff!"
"865","Very relaxing and nice time away.  I will definately go stay there again."
"866","My hotel package didnt include breakfast which was a pitty.  My friend stayed the first night in another single room and she got a lastminute deal for $100 including breakfast.  "
"867","Very nice hotel, clean friendly staff nice little gym and sauna, secure as late at night gates are closed and only access is via the security guard.Easy to travel into Barcelona and surrounding areas via local bus which stops 2 mins walk from the hotel. would definitely recommend staying and I would definitely go back."
"868","Location is good"
"869","Noisy and dated. "
"870","Good value for money, close to the beach and local amenities"
"871","Noise from disco and from children running along the corridors late at night"
"872","We had a great time at this hotel. It is central, near the beach and near center of town. Really recommend this hotel, we will be back :-)"
"873","I have only good things to say. Close to the airport without being noisy - perfect!"
"874","Building decor and facilities tired."
"875","Hotel near mall so plenty of food options"
"876","had a room only, no meals.  spacious well equipped room, good beds."
"877","none, personally i prefer smaller hotels than this one but difficult to find at equal price/ quality at st martins."
"878","Arrived at the hotel to be informed that they were fully booked and they could not understand how I had managed to make the booking on-line.  They found me another hotel about 5 miles away which was almost impossible to get to because of roadworks in the center.  I eventually got to my room at around 11.45 pm hungry,exhausted and above all very frustrated.  I therefore will not be using this facility in the future."
"879","Appartment was very clean, clear instructions were left for us with regards to emergency contacts, internet etc due to our late arrival. Owner came to meet us in the morning to ensure everything was OK with the facilities and did we need anything. Beautiful views. "
"880","Apartment is at the top of a hill, so not suitable for people that are not good with walking.   There is transport though into the town from just outside. (local bus)"
"881","Good location, spacious room with the option to cook if no wish to go eat in a restaurant alone; the room was quiet (except for the people in other rooms).   Balcony with a spavious view on the backsides of buildings, interesting.   Good breakfast (buffet style, variety).   Friendly staff."
"882","The walls of the room are quite dirty and paint is peeling off in some places, so the walls need some cleaning and refreshing.   Also, some dust on the floor next to the couch, and a few short hairs in the bathroom when I arrived.   People from rooms next door and upstairs are heard very easily.  The receptionist who checked me in didn't tell me that a magnetic card attached to the key has to be inserted into a slit in the wall behind the door in order to have electricity for the light switches. Maybe frequent travellers know this already, but it should be explained to every guest on arrival in my opinion."
"883","Near beach and town centre"
"884","All request before going ignored ....asked to be as high as possible away from lifs and noise ....we were put on 1st floor over the entrance which was very noises at night ...right next to the lift and stairs ....so not only did we get the noise of everybody in the hotel come in the entrance we also got it from people going up the stair ...out the lifts ....then we tried to book a safe and we were told to come back twice as they were changing shifts ??? ......defo won't book this again .......not enough sun beds for such a big hotel complex ...had to be down at 7 to get one if you were lucky "
"885","This hotel is in a fantastic location, right by Piazza San Marco. The staff were very nice "
"886","Breakfasts were very good.  Staff friendly. Comfortable, quiet accommodation."
"887","We got the impression that because we received a discount on the accommodation, we got the worst room in the hotel.  Really small compared to other rooms.  It was also in a block far removed from main center. On checking in, it was not queried whether we wanted a non smoking/smoking room and no one on hand to take luggage to our room. I do not believe that even with a reduced price we got great value for money from a hotel of this class.  "
"888","Staff was very friendly. Comfy beds and very quiet. I would stay there again."
"889","Everything was just as we wanted it to be. Great breakfast, helpful staff, clean area in and outside.   Free wi-fi - very nice.     Very good position at the beach."
"890","If there is anything to complain about it must the the cost of sunbeds, 8 € pr day... The neighbor offers sunbeds for 6€ ;)) - the hotel is a beach hotel, so beach towels would be nice. "
"891","The hotel location was near from the sea"
"892","The bed was not clean, the shower holder was broken. During the night neighboring doors close and open a lot because there was a nightclub in hotel. The  nightclub attendance was used hotel room for spend nice time with prostitutes, this is my thinking. I not recommend this hotel for any tourists."
"893","lovely staff , always happy to help .! ..   great food . "
"894","1) hotel room balcony requires lighting .   2) hotel room require tea /coffee facilities   3) bar at the pool not open very many times , meaning that you have to walk to the beach bar to get a drink "
"895","Very well located from Ohare. A small park lake nearby great to stretch your legs after a long flight. Shuttle bus is available from Ohare. However you may have to call hotel to ensure collection."
"896","Nice room over-looking courtyard, very generous breakfast, staff friendly. Good value for money. Hotel had character. Was very pleased to have chosen it."
"897","Not sure why photo ID requested, but they were happy to waive this when I had none."
"898","Housekeeping needs to do a better job, especially in the bathrooms, bathroom could have been fresher:"
"899","For best stay ask for a room overlooking the canal, this gives a real feel for Venice."
"900","Very beautiful hotel and the staff were amazing."
"901","I ordered my starter, not available.  Ordered a new one, not available,  ordered a certain wine, not available. The dinner was okay but not amazing and not worth the bill or the wait. Also aircon was far to loud but without it its far to hot.    "
"902","Very clean, great views of Bran Castle"
"903","Bag carrier did not fit the lift and staff did not offer to help.  "
"904","I upgraded on arrival to get a sea view.  The room was full of insects and I reported same to reception on arrival.  Nothing was done.  The room seemed actually dirty.  The stairs and corridors were filthy and never cleaned while we were there.  I stayed three nights even though I paid for seven and booked into a different complex for my last four nights so I ended up very much out of pocket.  I only got a refund of 48 euro being the 12 euro per night extra for last four nights.  I certainly would not recommend this complex to anyone and am very disappointed at being left out of pocket.  I will not be booking through Hotelopia again or recommending same to any of my acquaintances.  "
"905","We were very pleased with the hotel.  It was in the centre of town and the facilities were excellent."
"906","great position close to city centre. good value for money.  free parking a bonus."
"907","Unfriendly and unprofessional staff. Used 3 different rooms, not one was adequate : either the telephone or the TV or the air conditioning not working. Fridges not working in any of the rooms. All fridges apparently in the process of being replaced. Rooms facing the city very noisy during the night."
"908","Great location , great staff "
"909","Every single thing was beyond stunning. We apparently received an upgrade to the boutique hotel, my r/v is based on the suite we had here. It had 1 of the biggest private Jacuzzis and uninterrupted views (rm 19). The afternoon receptionist helped us book everything including an amazing day sailing. We had breakfast 1morning in our rm out of the 4 "
"910","Nice location, and nice view over the sea"
"911","Quality of service needs to be improved. While supposed to be a 5 stars hotel:  No lift to the rooms in the section i was in.   The Gym is out of function.   Lack of power plugs in the room to plug in your chargers / devices.  Quality of food not to the standards of a five stars hotel.  Price too expensive to the quality offered in other similar resources worldwide.  No pickup service or shuttle bus to "
"912","Very nice and help full staff."

"914","Also stayed in your hotel in Madrid last week and had same problem Not enough toilet roll!!! Or shampoo. Had to ask for more each day and we stayed 3 nights not acceptable"
"915","The professionalism and the friendliness of the front desk people. Sorry but nothing more"
"916","We were three and only had a small bottle of shampoo and body wash and the same with the room shoes.  The towels were old and frayed.  The hotel allows celebrations festivities all afternoon (not guests) at this time of year on Saturdays and Sundays.  Aunque tenga cinco estrellas no es un hotel para cinco estrellas"
"917","Really excellent facilities ,brand new  high quality shower  en suite  ,Lovely fluffy towels ,quiet room at the back.  Good value for money .Pleasant helpful staff."
"918","Room ( single)  was a little small. I'm told by a colleague that front facing rooms can be noisy "
"919","Very nice hotel very close to Disneyland, with an enclosed parking lot and very frequent shuttles busses to Disneyland entrance.  No negative comments whatsoever!"

"921","It is in a quite area but this could also be a positive"
"922","Free wifi in rooms a big plus. Good location and value for money"
"923","it was one of the best we have ever stayed.we are used to stay 5 stars hoteles all around the World.I can say this hotel was one the best one we have ever visited.delicious food so many sorts,nice animation,fantastics shows at night.no kids around, no shouting everybody respect each other,definetly we will visit once more,pehaps couple of times more.

"924","Nice small hotel. The room was clean, with a wardrobe and plenty of hooks to hang your clothes and towels. There was a also fridge. The bathroom was also fairly big and very clean. The staff was friendly and very helpful."
"925","The bread and croissants at breaksfast were disappointing (tasteless), but the buffet offered a wide variety of coffees, teas, fruits, and jams."
"926","Everything!"

Apparently everything had been taken away a year ago (to make more money!). It would have cost 5 DOLLARS to get room service to deliver hot water to the room for coffee / tea!! Can you imagine a 5 star hotel in London, or anywhere else for that matter doing that?!    Also, our room was not serviced on day (out of three), instead a note was put under our door saying we had displayed the Do Not Disturb sign. We didn't have a do not disturb sign!!! So we complained and somebody came to service our room at 23:45... ridiculous! "

"1162","Hi      Regarding this apartment - i am sorry but we were not that happy.      We picked up the keys from Hotel Plaza Nueva but were not informed that we had to switch on the boiler for hot water. On top of that the air conditioning was not working. There were no shower gels provided, and no toilet rolls.         "
"1163","I have booked a roomw/ a garden veiw  for 2 adults and 1 child 10 yrs. old. when we arrived they said that they have upgrade our into a superior one. I can't see any garden in our room and not only that, my son has no extra bed. I thought tha if you book for 3 persons, the extra bed is already included just like all hotels in Europe and some of other asian countries. they said I have to pay extra  for the extra bed and I argue and they told us tha they are giving free  an extra bed as a complementary. I have called them many times but the complementary bed was never  been delivered. We end up sharing a double bed which made our stay very uncomfortabel :-((. It's very noisy in the lobby. Never again Manila Penisula!"
"1164","Fantastic Location Loved our stay!!"
"1165","I stopped over on the  from Australia to UK. I just wanted to relax and had 2 nights  The hotel was near the airport. Accommodation very comfortable. Room and bed spacious. Restaurant excellent both breakfast and evening meal. Staff friendly and helpful. Pool and health spa excellent.   I'd recommend this hotel"

"1168","My husband and I are retired motel owners and were very impressed with the service, quality, cleanliness, manicured grounds, and intend to return when we can  stay longer. The location and beach area is ideal.  We couldn't have enjoyed our stay more.  Sincerely,  Ron "
"1169","please improove lobby "
"1170","Perfect for an overnight stay whilst flying into or out of KLIA.  Hotel is generally clean however we have noticed room cleanliness standards dropping in recent years.  This could be attributed to the very large turn over of guests.  Some guests are ignoring the NO SMOKING rules which makes is very unpleasant for other guests, however the reception was very quick to give us another room when this happened on one of our recent visits.  We use this hotel regularly and would recommend it but suggest that guests don't make their expectations too high.  It is a transit hotel with pool and gym and a decent reataurant, convenitenly situated to both the KLIA and LCCT airports, with free transfer from KLIA and transport for a fee to the LCCT."

"1175","Have to pay extra to have coffee in the room, did not expect that from a 5 star category hotel.  Some plastic covers that sorround the swimming pool was broken in multiple areas, very hazardous. The handle to get in and out of the pool was also broken, but overall we had a wonderful stay, will definitely consider it again in the future."
"1176","Very happy with the quality of this hotel and would definately go back without hesitation"
"1177","Beautiful lobby upon entering, staff very polite and helpful.  Food was lovely for the half board deal, very good value for money! "
"1178","Parking price at £7 at day for their own car park, was a little unfair.  Our room was definitely not at 4 star standards! There were nails sticking out the side of the bath panel by an inch or so, paper peeling of the walls, lime scale on the radiator from leaks, which had tried to be repaired with green stripy electric tape! The room had an awful smell,  we had to leave the windows wide open the whole stay, as it made me feel ill.  The mattress was stained badly, we could see it through the sheets. I was very disappointed with what I found as the reviews where so good. I know we had a good food deal and of course expected a cheaper room, but to be honest I have stayed in 3 star hotels with standard rooms much more 4 star than this. "
"1179","Hotel had recently been refurbished, everything was very clean. Staff were very helpful. Our special deal through Hotelopia included breakfast. At first the hotel did not recognise that, but after showing them a copy of my booking, they agreed and issued complimentary breakfast vouchers for the duration of the stay.  The accommodation was actually a terrace house with 2 bedrooms "
"1180","Great facilities (great beach, swimming pools, water slides and water park), the quality of the food was very good and the location of the beach."
"1181","The facilities appear run down and in need of repair.  The cleanliness of the rooms could much be improved.  There were no face towels and insufficient other towels.  The beds creacked and were of low quality.  Most of the staff either looked tired or were disengaged with service."

(Room 105)We reported to manager who agreed that this room was unacceptable, as we had only been staying for 1 night the manager offered my family a cold drink ."

I also found the staff to be much better in english then I had gotten the impression off from other reviews, in fact there was only two people during our complete stay that didn't talk english that well (the cleaning lady and one of the servants that took away dishes from the tables).    I would definitely recommend this hotel since we had a very nice stay (even if we don't consider this to be a 5 star hotel)"
"1217","I would certainly not rate it a 5 star hotel since there were many things that was broken or in need of restoration. For exampel lost pain on the walls, 2 out of 5 heated marble beds were working, the steam sauna was out of order, Under a bridge that crossed the pools there was broken wooden planks that you had to avoid when going under the bridge. There are tons of these kind of things and since we came here at the start of the high season then you would expect that these kind of things would have been fixed during the low season. Also there were long queues to the beverages during the dinners due to the fact that they didn't place out the regular soda machines (coca cola etc) so people could serve themself, instead you had to queue to ONE bar to get a glass of coca cola.    Things like this certainly doesn't give the impression of a 5-star hotel and I would only rate it a 4 star hotel.    Also they fail to utilize the two most amazing locations they have on the hotel which are the rooftop bar and the terrace with a waterfall where the tables and chairs are put into the shallow water pool so you can sit there. During our stay they didn't serve any beverages at the rooftop bar except for on a saturday and no beverages/food at the terrace. Since these are the two locations that we found to be really cool and unique then it's sad that they were pretty empty of people since there was nothing to do at the locations themself"

Eric and Bartholomew (well thats what they told us) where so friendly and made sure we were looked after.  the beds are probably the most comfortable ive ever slept in. location is perfect for walking distance from the center of liverpool "

"1230","We missed the fact that there weren't any ""little extras"" that you might expect in a high quality place, eg we were charged for a newspaper, no bath robes, etc. The tone of the information in the room was rather ""preachy"" for instance telling us that we must wear footwear to breakfast (we were not planning to go barefoot!). On several occasions there was no-one at reception and no bell to request someone to come."

The hotel does not have an proper website in English, my written request for a room with a seaview was not answered. Luckily, the staff was very helpful and put me into the hotel ""Las Arenas"" which is oviously cooperating with the management of Nautic Hotel.      "
"1236","very clean and professional.  Non-slip mat in shower."

"1239","Food is very poor, no fresh coffee in dining room - have to wait for main lobby bar to open at 10 am to get a fresh cup of coffee!  Many drunk guests while we were there so had to keep moving children out of harms  as tables went flying - even early in the morning!"
"1240","This was a last minute holiday and I booked not knowing much about the hotel, however all my worries were quickly over when we arrived and were greeted by very friendly staff and a lovely bar/pool area. We were promptly shown to our room which was very clean and had all the essentials needed (sink, fridge/freezer, kettle, small work top hob) there was ample clothes storage space in x2 wardrobe/drawer units and a small table with mirror. There was no TV which I liked as you don't go on holiday to watch TV anyway. The bathroom has a shower area in the corner (and yes there is no shower curtain which wasn't a problem but for some reason british reviewers online always seem to cry about it! Just close the door it's no problem!) There was a lovely little balcony which looked out  the pool area and was fairly close to the bar... This was very nice in evening as we could sit on our balcony and just hear the music and people enjoying themselves in the bar (we heard one couple complain about the bar noise once) however I think they must have been very boring people with nothing better to moan about because our room was literally right next to the bar and it didn't bother our sleep once and infact gave a lovely sense of atmosphere in the evenings. The hotel had a good range of breakfasts, snacks or meals on offer which were available throughout the day, all food we had was very good value and nice size portions. We went as bed and breakfast so had the choice of breakfast from the menu upto €4.50 each every morning which basically included every breakfast option bar one which was €5.00 euro but if you wanted that you just paid €0.50. We had a lovely English breakfast or omelette or other things on toast which I thought was great value for money and all nicely cooked food. The cleaners were very good and I think over the week stay we had 2 maybe 3 visits while we were out to clean the room, change sheets, towels, bins etc they were too very friendly and helpful. We spent most days out and about travelling the island and eating out but when we did stay at the hotel we used the pool area which was very nice and well cleaned by the older gentleman that seemed to do most of the pool duties, it was treated and cleaned everyday that we were there so I would disregard other reviews that say otherwise. There were ample sun loungers and umbrellas and two pools (small shallow pool for little ones, and a larger deeper pool for us big ones) we only went as a couple and it was ideal but i can also  imagine it would be great as a family hotel too as it was easy to keep an eye on little ones (we are planning to go back next year with family) they have a policy whereby you can only eat/drink items bought at the hotel by the pool which I had no problem with and infact didn't mind doing as I know they need to make a living too and there was a small shop with most essiensials attached to the bar/eating area which saves you walking to the supermarket in the centre anyway and in my eyes I would rather help out the hotel I was staying in than a supermarket in town. The bar was reasonably priced and had a good variety of beers, wines and spirits, soft drink and hot drinks. It is also a short walk to the beach, about ten minutes, and about 5 minutes to the main strip, so is easy to experience the beach and other bars/resteraunts that Alykanas has to offer (many great ones may I say- try millennium bar out very friendly place, great cocktails! And levante restraunt-best food we had all week!) I am 22 and stayed with my partner (also 22) for one week and really can not find fault with the stay I would like to say a big thank you to everyone that works at the Elpida for making my holiday a great one!

Mr. Sherif who organizes the trips offered us only 20% discount on the next trip....that we did not accepet.

Thanks to the general manager Mr. Gamal we had those 20 Euros back..    Long queue to get soft drinks and ""crepes"" (only one person serving...)"
"1260","The bathroom was not even remotely clean.    The staff left our room unlocked one day after replacing towels.    The male stuff were very inappropriate and made us feel very uncomfortable as two women staying at the hotel. This included them sending us notes trying to take us out at night, chasing us to our rooms and knocking on our door very late at night and very early in the morning."
"1261","bathroom was not cleaned well with very dated bath and WC and sink, the shower head was filthy, with black dirt all over the showerhead blocking the holes and I had to clean it to be able to have a shower, the shower curtain was filthy with stains all over on the inside.  I asked for a double room and booked it online, however the bed was no double bed but two very small single mattresses placed together. I was unable to get any sleep at night as I was ending up falling into the hollow space between the mattresses.  The room I was given was right next to the boilers and the fans and they were on all night and quite loud so I could not sleep most of the night and was exhausted the next day as I had an early start, so barelly slept 4 hrs and that too with interruption as the noise from the boiler room and fans was rather loud.  I wanted to pay for the hotel but the receptionist said he had already taken money out of my debit card when it clearly said on the hotelopia.com website that payment would be made at the hotel no payment would be taken from the debit card which was used only to reserve the hotel room. I was surprised that the receptionist said he had already taken the money out from my debit card!"
"1262","The Villa Jerkan is the ideal place for a nice and relaxing stay around Split. The facilities are simple but perfectly well-looked after. Our room (N°12) had a gorgeous view on Dalmatian Sea and was under the shade of a splendid palm tree. Each room has got its own kitchenette and you can purchase food from a mini market (open until late) 300m away.   The Villa car park is not located on site but is just over 400m along the main road.  From the Villa, walking along the beach you will find some good restaurants. We tried ""Jure"" and ""Mario's"". Both were simply good and very good value. The beach is literally on the Villa's door step. Don't forget wet shoes as the beach is made of gravel and pebbles. The sand start about a meter from the shore. Sunbeds are provided by the Villa for free and a big barbecue is also available. Free wifi.  The owner, Jerko, is a great character, he will make you feel warmly welcome and will give lots of good advice. Split centre is just 20min away by car. They are also buses running all day long. "

"1265","The staff were super friendly and attentive.  They went out of their  to accommodate.  I would definitely return!"
"1266","Excellent location for Corfu Town, excellent sea views. Great breakfast."
"1267","Staff were very welcoming and efficient and the breakfast was very good. The room was a good size and spotless. Overall very good value for money. The discounted fare arrangements with a local taxi firm, Cab Co, for travel into Canterbury were very useful, the service was quick and their drivers very helpful."
"1268","Complained about leaking toilet, it was dismissed as water leaking after using shower, floor continued to be wet and foul odours started, requested a look again and it was found the toilet had been leaking after all, was Lil upset as my children were exposed to unhygienic conditions after disputing it was shower water. Leak stopped then after they investigated second time. Overall their response to maintenance issues were extremely prompt"
"1269","Our second visit because the first one (last year) was so enjoyable. Prime location. Excellent breakfasts. Comfortable beds. Lovely pool."
"1270","None this time."
"1271","The hotel staff were very accommodating which is just as wel as they did not receive our booking. This meant due to a cancelation we were out in a double room rather than a twin and had to share a bed. Not ideal but the staff were very helpful and apologetic for your mistake. I would definitely stay in the hotel again however it is unlikely that I would ever book through your company again. Apart from the cancelation the hotel was fully booked and we could have ended up with nowhere to stay. Well done to the sleeperz hotel, shame on hotelopia for your mistake."
"1272","Nothing bad to say about the actual hotel, see above for complaint with hotelopia."
"1273","need improove lobby"
"1274","Just loved our experience. It is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at (and have stayed at some lovely hotels, including the Four Seasons). The room was fabulous, the amenities in the room were almost perfect, and the staff is welcoming and helpful."
"1275","I wish there had been a coffee maker in the room. I like to have a cup of tea before bed and when I wake up. It was very disappointing!"
"1276","Thin wall makes it very noisy when you stay at the same time as uneducated people..."
"1277","Nice swimming pools, delicious food and very friendly staff. "
"1278","We were told it was full, although we do make a reservation from the internet, and moved us to another hotel for the night.  "
"1279","It is near to the famous Jamaa el Fna square, but that's about it. "
"1280","food, wine, staff, proximity to the national park"
"1281","no insulation, you can hear all en suite. bad beach dirty sea."
"1282","1. Lovely big rooms  2. Very spacious public areas  3. Good feeling of service and quality"
"1283","1. WiFi access was very erratic and slow, As my partner was emailing with business it was very frustrating."
"1284","Nearly bech, nice crue, quietplace and good situated. We want go back again in september,"
"1285","Litle taired hotel, but the hotel is under restaurering hole time. So al in al, the hotel is very good. "
"1286","Nice facilities, close to the city center, very helpfull staff and management, nice pool area"
"1287","they need to improve the bath towels and pillows. The towels were threadbear and the pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable."
"1288","Transportation to nearest train station . There is no shuttle service after 23 o'clock and taking taxi is expensive. The hotel better provide 24 hours shuttle bus services if it want to attract customers!"
"1289","1. The room had no refrigerator to start with nor any complementary drinks or water. For as much as the hotel is charging per night, these should be a standard part of was is provided.    2. I have stayed in hotel in many countries in the world and have never met a ruder staff. The staff should be retrained to realize that it is the customers who pay their salaries (through patronizing the hotel) and not the other  around. A few staff member were very wonderful but overall the rest were just plain RUDE! If I had my  I will not recommend this hotel to anyone but I hear this is the only hotel of its start status in Maseru so I guess one is at the mercy of this type of services. "
"1290","very good position for the city centre shops"
"1291","we had the buffet which was Pork dinner but NO apple sauce was available although shown on menu???  we had to wait "
"1292","As a world traveler and  editor in chief of various lifestyle magazines below my opinion about Expo Hotel Valancia (based on price and quality):    The hotel rooms are clean and basic but good for a few days. The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent. Good breakfast. The location of the hotel was very good nice area and a good starting point to explore the city). There is an nice big shopping mall next to the hotel and you can park your car right in the area.  There is a nice pool on the roof (with terrace), with a beautiful view of Valencia. I recommend a room between the 7th and 11th floor to take. For a good restaurant you have to go to the city center.     We will definitely come back here!  D. Stam"
"1293","It has a great swimming pool which was excellent for cooling off after lots of sight seeing. The staff are friendly and professional. "
"1294","You can't charge pool drinks to your room, there's no tea coffee facility in your room and the room cleaning staff are noisy in the morning.  "
"1295","Great location, very clean, helpful staff, nice pool and bar area."
"1296","Lack of access to Internet. "
"1297","Great place to relaxs and enjoy with family.  Loads of exciting activities.Pub and Bistro staff   Are great, they really make my wife's birthday surprise   A memorable one.    "
"1298","Hotel's taxi over priced, from resort to Tanjong Uban Speedboat jetty cost us S$40.  It is like from Jurong to Changi in Singapore and from Sekupang to Nongsapura in Batam.  Even we wanted to go and buy some tidbits outside the resort, they charge us S$30 per  for a 10min drive.  "
"1299","Good and clean hotel, good location and personnel."
"1300","The iron sometimes was needed to pay 1 EUR for using, which was not prescribed."
"1301","did not receive my wake up call which could have been a disaster and caused me alot of stress and rush to the airport on checkout"
"1302","Well positioned"
"1303","This had the worst bed I had ever attempted to sleep on!  We were first put into an adjoining room, so the people were able to be heard, word for word... we were given a different room, which had no adjoining door...but the bed :-("
"1304","It was an absolutely pleasurable experience for an absolute bargain price!! Will definitely use again!! Brilliant facilities and brilliant staff! "
"1305","Very clean, very helpful staff- nothing was too much trouble. Fantastic facilities. Highly recommended."
"1306","Fab throughout - and great location. "
"1307","Very good,service excellent,food lovely staff friendly ,all in all I would say 8 out of 10, close to Regents Park,and close to Oxford st. And close to 3 subways.,well recommended ."
"1308","Some of the downstairs rooms are too close to the subway noise...no sleep there !"
"1309","Nice hotel good position within 15 mins walking time to the centre  highly recommended"
"1310","One slight problem the air conditioning did not work properly and the room was extreemly hot day and night"
"1311","Large suites, pleasant and quiet rooms, convenient beds, prestigious district"
"1312","The Bahamian Club restaurant was very average in all aspects, the food, the service, would not recommend eating there!"
"1313","Great hotel near Thor AirPort.  Restaurant, professional staff, pool, great rooms. Good value for the money."
"1314","dissapoident because when i arrived the manager mr SPANOS told that there is not room for me and he send me to another hotel"
"1315","We found Club Hotel Falcon adequite. It is not a 4 star hotel as per the european standards. It a good 3 star hotel.   Anyway we enjoyed our stay. The location is brilliant- breathtaking, peacefull and very enjoyable.  Close to Old Town of Kalechi- 20 min ride by bus KL10. The same bus goes to the first Lara beach. There are 10 beaches.   Food is oriented for eastern ueropeans. We liked it :)  Facilities are good. Guys from animation are friendly."
"1316","Housekeeping cleaned the room during the stayover only once after the complaint to the Reception. They usually change towels if they are left on the floor, and make the beds daily. But don't dream about the shower/sink being cleaned!  "
"1317","Very good location, it's in the middle between beach/old town and 'strip', very clean."
"1318","Not enough sunbeds at the swimming pool. You have to get up really early and leave your towel there if you want to get one. Could be more kitchen equipment."
"1319","The room is spacious and clean. Nice design and cozy. It is just above shopping centre and is just next to Mahkota Parade, Within walking distance to Jonker Street. My room is facing the pool and partial sea view. The pool looks simply beautiful in the night. Definitely will choose this hotel for every trip to Melaka."
"1320","The lift is always occupied and the restaurant is always full. Need to queue for breakfast."
"1321","None really..... just the pillows for the bed.  One was not enough and the continental was too big to actually sleep on."
"1322","Professional and friendly staff, beatuiful facilities, good and varied breakfast ,2 pool areas,many activities for the children, close to the beach. Will certainly come again"
"1323","The matresses was hard and bumpy"
"1324","Comfortable hotel - only complaint is they have a lot of double doors in the hallways which are not easy to get through with large suitcases.  Surprisingly quiet considering location to the airport.  Easy to get to airport although Hoppa bus takes a while, if you have only small luggage you can catch a red bus for free at the stops outside which are much quicker. Breakfast was good and included in price. Car rental nearby but note that car rental only provide shuttles to the airport so if not going straight to airport get rid of your bags first."
"1325","Very clean and great staff"
"1326","Shared bathrooms and location was far from the city center"
"1327","This has an impressive foyer but the rooms are fairly standard (think mid-low range chains i.e. Holiday Inn, Days Hotel etc). It is fine if location is your primary concern.  It is noisy as a result of the location but not too terribly so. It's clean, the staff are pleasant and it was great for easy access to the train station - I had an early journey."
"1328","Clean, well presented and spacious. "
"1329","Hopelessly hot with no air conditioning (We stayed in June). We barely slept at all due to the temperature on night one - even with two fans going full pelt. On the second night we moved the mattress into the living room so we could have the window open. Suggestion for the designers of the block: If you're going to have internal bedrooms with no windows you really should install air conditioning! For this reason alone, we are unlikely to go back. "
"1330","Great location, friendly staff!!!"
"1331","Very helpful owner called mantha. Good communication before we arrived organising transfer from airport. Very quiet surroundings which was fab in the evening with little ones. Short walk to main shops/restaurants/beach.  Clean and friendly, highly recommend "
"1332","  All the staff at the hotel were excellent from the driver who met us at the airport to the manager of the restaurant. The reception staff were able to deal promptly with a problem regarding our booking through a third party."
"1333","Very comfortable and very clean indeed. Value for money."
"1334","Front of House staff are brilliant and could not do enough to be helpful. Very clean and simple hotel with everything you need to stay overnight. Flat for wheelchairs but has a step into shower but if you bring your own shower seat you easily use the ground floor rooms. Cobbled pathway okay if you have good wheelchair skills."
"1335","Breakfast is not great - very basic but really this hotel is good value for money."
"1336","the rooms are dirty and old. carpet is disgusting , how can you classify this as a 5 star hotel!!! 2 stars maybe..will never go there again"
"1337","There was a great variety in the selection of food for breakfast. Location: not too bad. Took us about 10-15 mins to the night market, Bt Ferringhi beach where we did our water sport activities. If you don't want to take the taxi, you can take bus service 101 (bus fare RM1.40) which ply outside Hydro. Staff service was not too bad. Would be nice if the other staff especially those at the restaurant would smile more. We requested for a change of room and staff tried their best to accommodate our request. The scent of lemon grass upon entering the toilets was nice."
"1338","We booked 4D3N at Hydro.The room assigned to us, the toilet facilities was not functioning well. I had to wait for about 10-15 mins to get the water closet flushed. The safe was not working for us to store our valuables. There were no face and floor towels in the bathroom. The hair dryer, too, were not functioning well. Needed to get a replacement. There were no glasses for us to use to rinse after brushing our teeth. Staff from housekeeping came knocking on our door wanting to make the room when we were still in the room. That disturb our rest The room were not made up even after we put up the ""Make up room"" door sign. That was why we requested to change our room.  In the new room, everything seems ok with the facilities in the room. However, we requested for a change of towels the next day, only the bath towels were changed but not the face and floor towels. The wardrobe doors almost came off and made it difficult for us to open and close the doors. One of the morning we wanted to have breakfast but most of the tables were full with guests. We waited for a while, when we managed to get an empty table. One of the hotel staff changed the table cloth other table and to our shock, the table cloth was stained with white patches all over the top. It was unsightly and unhygienic.. We decided not to find another table.  Suggestions for improvements: TV programs were boring, outdated and the same programs were repeated. Should install hooks or hanger in the toilets for guests to hang their bags on the ground floor and the lobby (I had to place my bag on the floor which was slightly wet at one point). Maybe place the scents (lemon grass) like those in the toilets in the bathrooms in the guest rooms. Don't mean to complain, just giving constructive criticism for improvement. That is all."

"1341","Easily found, free parking and a pleasant walk into town alongside the Roman Aquaduct."
"1342","Good location and fairly easy to find by car, the rooftop terrace was open until late, popular with young locals -good atmosphere and reasonable prices. Nearby parking for about 13euros a day."
"1343","Room with hotelview are nice. the area and the hotel is NOT for push-chairs and the ealderly!  It's a 2 star but in my opinion worth minimum 3 star. Rooms beautifull, kitchen is perfect! Staff is friendly! Nice location, shops, beach supermarket on walking distance ( but it's up and down the hill)"
"1344","The kids area is small and old. I would not come here for all-incl. holiday with children.. You have to go out and spent more. "
"1345","Cheap  1km from the beach  Wireless in the rooms"
"1346","Staff  Breakfast   Toilet hygiene  Pool area and pool dirty"
"1347","Standards same always very consistent and helpful friendly staff."
"1348","well staffed, ideal location "
"1349","room needs some TLC and the windows need replacing due to drafts and noise. Breakfast needs to be ofa better quality from a hotel of this price."
"1350","Clean and peaceful place. We stayed four nights and we had a nice moment. Full security and surrounding is good compared to other places in joburg.  We enjoyed the complimentary apple everyday   "
"1351","Great no frills stay everything you need  for a comfortable stay."
"1352","Some of the showers are getting a bit tired and dirty."
"1353","Staff where friendly , room basic in 5 days towels where changed once in the room , food was quiet poor not much of a selection at all .  No air con in rooms as stated there was and at 31 degrees it was needed. "
"1354","The staff were fabulous. We were upgraded (it was our wedding night) and it was a beautiful surprise for us that evening and made nor stay even more special!  "
"1355","Breakfast at the conservatory finishes too early so if you have a late check out or want to enjoy the room, you have to compromise breakfast  room service is a bulbous ( have had it previously) bit not everyone wants to eat breakfast on their room. "
"1356","Clean and tidy, staff quite friendly."
"1357","Small Room with limited facilities, breakfast poor."

"1367","Reception staff were very friendly and offerred plenty of advice about things to do, places to visit.  the courtesy transport to and from the airport and around abq was very helpful"
"1368","This was my second visit, and the experience was as positive as the first. "
"1369","Very good location, nice to have access to a swim in the sea. Nice and friendly staff."
"1370","A minibar where you have to order things one day ahead is an unconvenient minibar. Also there are quite a few inconvenient structures, too many forms to fill in and too many deposits to pay. The menu (what is offered at which time) at the Tiki Bar changes so often it is impossible to plan for."
"1371","I had a lovely stay at the hotel. Stayed bed "
"1372","The reception staff we're very kind  "
"1373","Polite and professional staff.  Lovely room.  Valet service very quick to return car, and not much more than parking in NCP yourself (if you can navigate around Bristol!)"
"1374","Took an age to get a lift in the mornings (only 2 so in constant use over 17 floors).  Cooked breakfast ran out very quickly."
"1375","Excellent hotel facilities and staff in an area we like "
"1376","I was very disappointed that the hotel was overbooked and my reservation was not honoured. I will not be making any more reservations here for this reason."
"1377","Great location to everything."
"1378","Well I  would not want to have duvets in sheets when it is so hot - hope you go to a sheet and optional blanket system. This affected my decision not to come back in July when we return."
"1379","very polite staff who really seemed to want to help. Customer service is lacking in alot of consumer areas these days so was very impressed."
"1380","positioning of the TV ut not a hardship to move it."
"1381","Modern, close to railway station "
"1382","We returned to our room at approx 3.15pm and our room was still not cleaned/made up"
"1383","The rooms were ok despite the not so welcoming exterior."
"1384","Hardly any facility.  Not a hotel, more like a well mentained high class motel."
"1385","Air conditionning not working well (too hot)"
"1386","The hotel had over booked and therefore couldn't accommodate me. "
"1387","Felt very welcome and enjoyed our stay"

"1390","Unfriendly staff not willing to help. "
"1391","On the website is showed towel are included but when I got there I had to pay for it.  It was quite noisy through night, because almost all the guests were teenager and were running and talking throughout the hall and knocking the doors including my door.  It was really annoying"
"1392","We always enjoy every experience at the Oyster Box . Being able to have our small dog with us is an extra pleasure."
"1393","Room had all facilities, even air conditioning!  Although fronting the main road it was quiet and generally comfortable.  Food was very good although choice limited in the evening.  Plenty of plugs for phones, iPad and laptop, no juggling tv/kettle/bedside lamp etc as is sometimes necessary in some very up-market places.  Sufficient for my purposes."
"1394","Very tired old Georgian building.  Steep stairs and no lift, wouldn't want to lug a suitcase for two people for a week  up to the second floor!  Carpet in reception area looked like it had been retrieved from a skip.  Twice.  Suspect owners now are in the trap: to charge more you need to invest, to invest you need to charge more.  If you use this hotel, do not expect to be stunned by the decor but do expect to be pleasantly surprised at what you get for the price."
"1395","Absolutely fabulous value. Huge room with everything you need. Stunning location with views of the sea and the mountains. Staff were all friendly and extremely helpful and greet you at arrival with a glass of Kir Royal, perfect after a long journey. Excellent choice of food. Especially at breakfast. Lovely grounds and great facilities. The spa had an offer on for a massage or facial with all-day entrance to the spa's facilities which I opted for. Best massage i have ever had followed by a complementary iced water, chocolate truffle and glass of cactus liqueur. Marvellous. Would go back in a heartbeat."
"1396","Some noise in the rooms with people coming back to their rooms with no consideration for those already in bed, but sadly this happens everywhere! Sunbeds could be a little more comfortable (a metal bar towards the back made them uncomfortable to sit or lie on in a number of positions), but these things didn't really detract from our overall enjoyment of our stay."
"1397","Hotel was bright and clean. Small but functional rooms. Great value for central London."
"1398","Breakfast was toast, slices of cheese and meat, with cereals on offer. Disappointing. Atmosphere was somewhat chaotic at breakfast with no instructions on what to do. "
"1399","Great city centre location, great staff and facilities."
"1400","King size bed is 2 singles zipped together which makes for an uncomfortable or separate nights sleep !"
"1401","This hotel was ideally situated in Santa Eulalia in a very quiet location close to the Marina and not subject to traffic noise. It offers a full range of facilities and the staff are very friendly and approachable.  "
"1402","1.Although the rooms are perfectly adequate,the walls are very thin and do not offer much privacy.  2.On arrival we were asked to sign a declaration that we would not reserve sunbeds or hang towels over the balcony. During our stay these rules were ignored by a large number of residents which made it difficult to find a sunbed and parasol.The management made no attempt to remove towels from reserved beds which encouraged the practice even further.There are insufficient parasols for the number of beds.     3.Hotel prices were reasonable,but the cost of Wi-Fi was not - for a hotel of this size and stature free Wi-Fi should nowadays be included in the tariff. "
"1403","I like the location ,it's so close to the beach.all resturant's and caffee are near by."
"1404","One of your staff really stood out, all the staff were friendly and helpful but Nicholas exceeded all expectations"
"1405","One meal consisted of COLD chips"
"1406","facilities  value for money clin  prof,staff"
"1407","The staff tried,at every stage, to deal with a monolingual client. "
"1408","Availability of an iron and board for travellers would have been an asset."
"1409","Rooms are dates / tired.  Need updating of the furniture and the decor.  Air Conditioning terrible.  Also. 24"" CRT tv's - not even flat screen version of only TV sets.  Also, only 10 TV channels?????"
"1410","Good location  Excellent staff in the reception  "
"1411","The cleaning of the room could have been better"
"1412","Good location,  good size."
"1413","Our room was available when we arrived at 1:30pm. We needed to attend a reception at McGill at 2:30 pm. Your staff was not willing to try to accommodate us until I offered to upgrade to a suite. Even then, your staff was not willing to confirm the same room for the rest of my stay while I Kept saying that I would pay the difference. I only had the same suite confirmed the next day upon my inquiry.  The lobby was so crowded and with people eating lunch boxes when the hotel had a function indicating your facility is very insufficient."
"1414","The hotel is well priced compared with many others on Langkawi and we found the room cleaning staff really efficient but that is really where the positives end. The pool is large, but everything badly needs renovated - rooms and pool area are old and tired. (There is a new pool being built at the moment which is a positive, it's nice to see that they are injecting some money into maintenance projects, however until it is finished there is no beach view, just some blue tarp to hide the building work and bear in mind you can hear the building work while swimming/ sunbathing) "
"1415","In hindsight, we would have been much better off to choose a more expensive hotel which had a good standard of service, rooms etc and probably would not have been much worse off financially, when you take into account that Holiday Villa charges extra for just about everything they can: no free water in rooms, pay for wifi, pay for tea and coffee sachets in the rooms, very expensive breakfast etc etc....    The staff at reception are disinterested and unhelpful. We left a bag at the Langkawi ferry terminal and ended up hiring a car and driving to the ferry to enquire in person whether the bag had been handed in (it had and we got it back safe and sound) however the hotel staff couldn't have given us much less assistance in trying to locate our lost luggage. In the middle of changing currency one of the reception staff quoted the exchange rate (which was incorrect) then simply walked away, mid conversation, out of the hotel door and off up the driveway on a break with another colleague, no explanation, did not hand over to another staff member - just disappeared half  through dealing with a guest!    We booked a deluxe room, the original room we were given was on the ground floor, it was dark, depressing and badly in need of a refit. The whole place has the air of a resort which was quite nice 20 years ago, but somewhere along the lines they stopped caring, maintaining, servicing and helping..... what a shame."

The whole place has the air of a resort which was quite nice 20 years ago, but somewhere along the lines they stopped caring, maintaining, servicing and helping..... what a shame."
"1418","Hotel ticked all the right boxes. well maintained room gardens and swimming pools"
"1419","Staff were extremely helpful, hotel decor was good, the seaview outside our room was absolutely amazing.  Free Internet thoughout the hotel was an added bonus. Our price included dinner in the Rosewater which was a lovely restaurant with endless choice.  Free turtle chocolates were left for us on our beds in the evening,which was very cute."
"1420","Terrific location,  good value for money definitely.  Very personable, professional and helpful staff.  I'll definitely use this hotel again."
"1421","Close to Airport and parking good"
"1422","1. Large puddles in carpark very deep, so bad water control when built.  2. No ""Key Drop"" box, for key return outside ""Limited Office hours."
"1423","Everything was fine for a budget style hotel  Close to bus, monorail and rail station  Plenty of eateries nearby"
"1424","Great location, small boutique hotel, great staff."

"1429","just the steep hill to get to it but the views were worth it.. "
"1430","The staff were excellent and friendly.  The hotel and rooms were clean and looked impressive."
"1431","Room cleaners sometimes moved luggage on floor and interrupted things that we had laid out.  "
"1432","Pretty good location. "
"1433","Lift not working. Only the cold water tap worked on the sink. Toilet flush was hanging off the wall. Shower didn't drain away and dripped for an hour after use. Paper thin walls with constantly noisy pipes. Not even a bed-side table, just a phone on the floor. Get what you pay for I guess. "
"1434","Beautiful apartment. Huge and very clean. Very quiet location of resort. Excellent children's entertainment."
"1435","Reception staff were efficient but not very attentive or welcoming but Alexandria on breakfast was the most wonderful and friendly staff member!   No mini supermarket to buy any provisions.  If you don't have a family then not really ideal for couples as lots of children."
"1436","Excellent location for Heathrow Airport. Great customer service and room size. Very celan and modern. I enjoyed my stay with Premier Inn. "
"1437","I would recommend that you have iron facility in every single room. Breakfast was nice, however scrambled eggs were not nice. I felt like I was eating grass. "

"1449","constant mouldy smell in the room."
"1450","Friendly hotel staff.   Clean rooms.   Close proximity to subway. "
"1451","More of a boutique hotel (no swimming pool).   "
"1452","The furnitures were nice. Front desk ladies were very friendly compare to the men. The men were not as inviting than the women. The front lobby was nice and the pool area had a lot of sitting area. There is always a place to sit."
"1453","The pool was not clean and not strong enough chemical for me to swim in. The locals got serve before the foreigns. It's unfortunate. "
"1454","Studio room size is big attache with an oversize bathroom which is modern and clean .twinbeds are big and can fit in 2 adult and 2 kids . I believe they only refurbish the rooms but not the lobby . Only free wifi is available in the lobby whereas you have to pay for it in the room .Camerron hotel are all not convenient u have to drive around so as to reach the places of interest Location is right up on a mountain , weather is great good for families food wise so so but can be improved in Jim thompson terrace . It has a beautiful view from there"
"1455","5 stars hotel.  Outstanding.I own 2 hotels in Buzios,and I was really surprised for the extremely high quality of the service,decoration,comfort,location (we arrived by train)  The restaurant bistro was delicious and waiters very kind indeed and profesional.  Very pleasent stay.Congratulations"
"1456","The hotel is WONDERFUL! Two big outdoor pools, SPA with 2 indoor pools, Sauna, Steambad, Hammam, jacuzzi, and incredible amount of massages and beauty treatments. Very big rooms with balcon. Beautiful, elegant. The bus stop is one street away, and very close to the Azure Window. Definitely this is an experience that you have to live! As a couple in a relaxing holiday, WE LOVED IT! :D"
"1457","The hotel is good value for money and close to city centre. The only thing I would say is that we asked to borrow an iron and there was none available. This was the fourth hotel/B"
"1458","Location of the note is great   If room facing the lake its great n light.  Furniture is classy   rooms are clean  parking is provided which is very helpful."
"1459","Five star hotel and you pay for your own tooth brush,not really 5*.  If room is on street side very dark n noisy.  Breakfast is nice but take time to replenish stuff too long  Staff(breakfast waitresses)should smile and be friendly,they need to show that they are happy to work there"
"1460","We loved the old fashioned charm of this hotel - and our room was more like a suite than just a room!  The food was extraordinary - at an amazingly reasonable price.  The Head Waiter couldn't have been more accommodating. Reception staff were extremely helpful.  "
"1461","We had a lovely relaxing stay in an idyllic surrounding.   One staff member kiat was extremely helpful and organised us a boat trip of the island which I really recommend.   Perfect for relaxing but also great snorkelling. "

"1463","good because of the special price i recieved"
"1464","friendly, knowledgeable and efficient staff. Would recommend the hotel to any of my friends and acquaintances."
"1465","Very nice hotel with a fresh greak buffe, something available for every taste and a kids buffe as well.  Dishes changed every day.  Pool bar available all day long, not only drinks and ice cream, also piza slices and similar."
"1466","Nothing negative about the hotel but the beach closest to the hotel is not very nice.  A rental car or something is recommended.  Also mail the hotel to get description where it is if you drive, someone (not the hotel) has wrongly pointed out the hotel in Google maps."
"1467","sometimes staff forgot to replace the showergel and glass."
"1468","Staff very unfriendly   Breakfast very very very limited  Electricity cut outs during the day and can take a while to come back on.   Pay extra for room safe  Lack of hot water at peak times for showers   Pool dirty and small  Hotel located in a construction area of other developments  No proper beds if theirs more than one person. Others have to use sofa beds  Smoking throughout the hotel is allowed"

"1473","The hotel might need some works on toilets, a new ones, but can't complain everything was good, is just a suggestion."
"1474","My wife is an event coordinator and cannot help but review hotels and venues even when we are on holidays.  She was very impressed with the level of professionalism from the staff, the excellent facilities and immaculate grounds.  The food was great and housekeeping very helpful and accommodating to our requests. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel."
"1475","Staff at reception are very helpful, rooms are nice and clean and very modern"

"1481","Water pipe under washing basin was leaky. The cafe service is not professional.   "
"1482","Good, clean hotel, well situated."
"1483","We booked and paid for transfers from Palma Airport  to hotel and return from hotel to airport.  The hotel did not receive any notification regarding what time we were to be collected from the hotel to go to airport.  The hotel receptionist tried unsucessfully to find out details from Hotelopia.  I made several calls to Hotelopia helpline but was kept waiting on hold incurring expensive call cost.  We did not receive any assistance and had to take taxi to the airport at additional cost of 16 euros."
"1484","Small swimming pool is 3.5m depth. Room service cannot reach standard."
"1485","Free wifi provided and near monorail station."

"1490","Good deli breakfast , good location, nice restaurant"
"1491","Charged me $10 for ringing the super shuttle I did all the talking you just rang the number and charged me. I would not recommend this hotel for that one reason.  They did not explain to me the cost just received my account with it on.  I could have used my own cell phone if they just gave me the number."
"1492","A lot of construction going on right next to the hotel. But the sound does not bother you. The seaview is ruined."
"1493","They did great job for Deaf Device (Clock Alarm with vibarate) for me"
"1494","I did called them before I reservation, some questions - when I arrived - they said no or not available. I did asked them - they said yes as we have! They lied to me - but others  I am happy."
"1495","Nice place to stay, comfortable, situated in the city centre of Arkhangelsk."
"1496","Fantastic value for money, the Staffa were really helpful and friendly.  We were a group of girls and felt really safe especially with the 24hr reception, they were quite happy for you to come back late after nights out too. The maid came everyday and left the apartments with clean towels everyday.  The food in the restatuarant (and free welcome cocktail) was really reasonable, fresh and tasted great  Reception happily book taxis for you to go into town, really nice to be that bit further away from the bustle of the busy San Antonio "
"1497","Nothing really, take beach towels as they don't supply them"
"1498","I have found that my credit card has been accessed . I used it to pay for the hotel accomodation before I went and did not use it any other time while away. When I came back I have found that i have three entries on my credit card not mine. The bank cannot say exactly where the problem started but only overseas payment I have made was to pay the hotel account. "
"1499","All the staff at the hotel are really nice and helpful. I would like to say a special thank you to Ibrahim, Mustapha, Tarek, Mohammad and Lubna who i personally dealt with and were of great assistance and made me feel very comfortable. The hotel staff are amazing. The breakfast was really nice and had a good range of buffet selection. "
"1500","The hotel facilities can be improved. We had 2 rooms. There was no mini bar in one of them so had to ask for one. Both the minibars were working poorly. When we arrived at the hotel we were not given any water even though it was really hot outside and we had we were tired from our travel. We were also not given a map or information about the city. The hotel should at least offer water to arriving guests, give them a map of the city and some information. "
"1501","good location in centre of sorrento.good access to other places on the coast.nice pool area."
"1502","charged for having a fridge in hotelroom,no free towels for pool.breakfast was very basic and not much choice,coffee also not proper Italian coffee,just instant!balconys not very private(you can see your neighbours)"
"1503","Very clean and in good shape.Breakfast good and fresh.Staff obtained drs. number for my wife's medical situation."
"1504","We had to check out early due to an unexpected medical problem.Asked for 2 days credit.Told by front desk staff that since we booked thru a booking service,had to contact them.When we contacted booking service,was told that was NOT true.Hotel could have given us credit."
"1505","Lovely building in a very central location."
"1506","We had only booked for two nights, first night we were not able to stay in the hotel supposedly due to an electricity problem. We were provided an alternative location which I have to say was well below par right down to the very dirty bed sheets that had simply been turned around with the last customer."
"1507","We were very pleased with front desk staff (a pretty "
"1508","Having to pay a service charge for ordering 2 coffees, even tho they took just shy of 15mins to get to us."

"1513","too hard to find (the lacation is not good)   very good for the traveler that he know well bkk but not so good for frist travelr "
"1514","Not all of the showers on the 1st floor were working, although there were builders working, so they are probably being updated/repaired"
"1515","Great location, very good breakfast, clean rooms and very helpful staff! Highly recommended!"
"1516","I had a very nice stay at the hotel. The room was a very good room. Staff were professional at all times. The reception staff seemed very efficient. The younger gentleman concierge was very helpful and I felt went out of his  to welcome us."
"1517","The food was good but although the menu was different every night the flavours were very similar for every day. After a few days of similar tasting food it seemed bland.    I also noticed there was a roof terraced which was closed. This would have been a very nice place to view sunset.    The TV picture quality was not very good and only there was only one channel for English language."
"1518","Excellent location right in front of the beach and close to a supermarket. Lovely balconies overlooking the sea. Very reasonably priced for northern-Europeans."
"1519","Tiny bathrooms with a toilet squeezed in - hardly place to turn around in the shower. Non-descript decor, showing signs of wear and tear and positively ancient television with little to offer in terms of channels."
"1520","What a terrible hotel. It should be a 1star or a hostel"
"1521","Beds broken, bathrooms dirty, changed rooms 3 time due to bad terrible odours, management terrible.     We had a terrible experience  over priced never will I stay in a hotel like this again.                "
"1522","Good hotel to spend holidays with a partner!  Nice location along the sea to enjoy day "
"1523","Reasonable facility with reasonable price.  Better ensure room service during 24 hours."
"1524","I booked for several of my colleagues through your website and they have advised that check in was a very long process as they did not appear to have the bookings, even though they has the vouchers with them.  It appeared on average to take 30 - 40 minutes to check in.  One of my colleagues arrived at 4.30 pm and was told that her room was not yet ready - this is not the service that we would expect.  This applies to all 9 - 10 rooms that I booked with you last week."
"1525","We had 1 of the 7 sea facing rooms which we had booked which had a lovely view  the swimming pool and ocean.  These are self catering units which have a lovely little kitchen which is more than adequate. The public beach is a mere 50 meters walk from the hotel where you can get chicken Kebabs and chicken curry for 100/150 Mauritius rupees from the locals. Also close to the hotel 100/150 meters are some local restaurants, limited supermarket and a place to exchange money. The bus stop to Grand Bay is practically out side the hotel and it is only 4.5 kms away at 22 rupees one . Grand Bay has many restaurants to choose from, tour operators and the Super U super market has got everything you would need. this is also where the night life happens. So overall I can highly recommend the Mont Choisy Beach Resort and would definitely go back there again. Sadec and his team off staff are to be well complimented."
"1526","Extremely clean place, friendly and helpfull staff, nice pool.Quiet location a 15 min. walk or a 1€ taxi ride from the medina.I recommend the place."
"1527","very welcoming and friendly"
"1528","Great SPA and Aurveda section particularly!"
"1529","Gazebo restaurant menu could be improved."
"1530","The hotel met all my expectations and they made all efforts to ensure that we had a comfortable stay.  I would stay at this hotel again"
"1531","Very pleasent stay, the staff was always very helpfull and smiling."
"1532","Free upgrade to a suite.  Outstanding breakfast and service.  Staff friendly but professional.  Rooms cleaned to a high standard."
"1533","The Fixed Air Conditioning in the room was not working and a free standin unit had been placed in the room with venting through an open window.  Maintenance not of the highest standard with light bulbs requiring replacement and some tubes flickering.  Greater attention to detail required."
"1534","Very nice refurbishment of the hotel since 2010. Nice staff in reception. Great location very close to Lancaster gate hotel."
"1535","BIG MINUS - very hard beds. Had pain on hips every night from sleeping. Staff said all beds where the same and we put an extra blanket underneath the sheets, but not much difference. Old building so all sounds are loud, even from lift ouside in the corridor to next door room. Creaky floors."
"1536","The only negative, the bed mattresses are far to hard for any lengthy stay. "
"1537","able to check in early-parking nearby at reasonable rate.great location"
"1538","I did not have any food as I had an early train to catch on Sat morning"
"1539","Really friendly and helpfull staff, good location near the airport."
"1540","Wifi shuold be much improved"
"1541","1. Located in the south of the Strip,  not as noisy as other hotels alongside the strip.  2. Convenient to airport, bus station and all other places"
"1542","1. Swimming Pool time is bad.  2. No wifi.  3.  Operator services need improvement : when asked if there is wifi, the answer was 'no' and hanged up. But phoned again and asked 'is there any pint net services?' the answer was    'there is an Internet cable next to the tv (of course you have to search all over the places near the tv - and found the cable hiding at the back of the 'drawers'), and can only connected to a computer !! (try a D-link 505 (or similar function equipment, it can turn the signal to wifi)  "
"1543","Stayed at this hotel several times and we have always found it to be a good experience. Staff are always available without being intrusive, it offers all that you could want for a short stay and is very convenient for the city centre. Will use again in the future. All areas including the dining room were very clean and the room was well prepared."
"1544","Arrived to be told we didn't have a room for the night as they had closed some rooms off. They had booked us into a hotel in Eastbourne , some 20 minute drive away which was not acceptable as we were attending a 25th wedding anniversary party in Lewes and wished to walk to NOT to take a taxi.  We found alternate accommodation eventually and original hotel paid most of the difference. Cannot believe we were turned away at the eleventh hour,so it was not a very pleasant experience!"
"1545","Nice hotel. Very spacious rooms with some lovely views. Staff were exceptional as they were extremely helpful, prompt in dealing with any requests and were extremely friendly and polite. I Was really impressed that staff remembered me by name after only speaking once, considering the size of the hotel and the number of guests staff must interact with each day. Handy location in Downtown Miami with regular bus services to South Beach and north to Aventura Mall."
"1546","in specification it should be a studio with the kitchen "
"1547","The rooms are nice and of a good size in London."
"1548","The staff at the reception could have appeared more professional and passionate.    A twin room was booked. It was requested to have a quieter room not facing the street on the day, the staff arranged a double bed room without taking into consideration of my booking preference nor notice of change of room type. At the time of my check in, only one staff was at the reception desk. She was multitasking with phone calls and different enquiries of guests which was quite under staffed.     It's also worth mentioning that the luggage storage service could have been arranged in a better . I was advised to fill in a tag, put it on my luggage and enter the luggage room all by myself. The helpfulness of the staff and the security issue could be improved. "
"1549","We found it to be a warm friendly hotel. Staff extremely courteous and helpful. The location and proximity to shops perfect. Rooms spotless. Would recommend for any category of guest ie person travelling alone, business person, family etc. The hotel felt very safe and secure and represented excellent value for money. We would definitively stay there again."
"1550","brand new, very spacious and luxuriouse rooms"
"1551","Room was tidied each day and staff were courteous and helpful. Rooftop pool was nice, location of the hotel very good, and of course, it was very cheap."
"1552","Clearly in need of some updating - various staining on walls, ceilings, shower curtain etc... TV didn't work, bedside lamp had no bulb.. curtains were half hanging off the rail. None of these major problems, but clearly room for improvement. "
"1553","Very good value , near to the airports , friendly polite staff ."
"1554","Fantastic customer service. Dave was excellent, had a traumatic time being caught up in the floods and thought would never make it to jasper but they kindly extended my stay and moved my booking with ease.   Room-clean, very comfortable bed,lovely toiletries. Easy to park. close to everything. Reception staff all very helpful and approachable. Fridge in room."
"1555","Only negative is only a coffee maker in the room, can't really get hot water for tea, but am sure reception would offer one if really needed, I never asked. no safe in the room either."
"1556","The only positive is the Front Desk Staff, ""Mr. Iamtakin"" (don't know correct spelling) - and the bellboy (wore glasses) very very helpful and helped change our room (3) times to accommodate us - since the initial rooms had broken air conditioners, poor condition of bathrooms etc.  Also their inside pool was damaged and the initial hotel front desk staff gentleman helped in using the pool next door.  Excellent staff."
"1557","Very poor conditions entirely.  The bathroom atrocious - it had broken sliding doors, bolts sticking out of the shower wall.  Hotel elevator broken buttons.  Hallways smelled of cigarette smoke.  The air conditioning was poor. I would recommend that this hotel be refurbished."
"1558","we really enjoyed our stay at carna bay hotel,great value for money,very clean ,had a front room loved the view,we had our evening meal and breakfast great service great food"
"1559","Very clean, great view of loch Ryan"
"1560","Very friendly staff, who smiled when greeting etc. That one thing makes so much difference."
"1561","Hotel and staff very friendly, good service and clean rooms. Breakfast also included which is a plus."
"1562","No negatives about hostel but NEGATIVE ABOUT HOTELOPIA. They had not let the hostel know of our booking so we did not get our rooms we asked for, meaning that we did not get ensuites and my friend was left in a room with no windows. Hotelopia have not even bothered to reply to my letter of complaint, DO NOT BOOK THROUGH HOTELOPIA BOOK THROUGH HOSTEL. Will not be booking with hotelopia again."
"1563","Maria - Incharge of the kids club was outstanding. It helped a lot that she knew English very well and 5 more languages. My 8 year old and 5 year old daughters really enjoyed the stay at Miracle Resort.    Also, the gentleman incharge of the fitness center was very pleasant and very nice with my family as well. He really makes us feel welcome. He sometimes helped in the Spa as well and my daughters got an unforgetable Turkish bubble bath.     If in the future I have to travel to Turkey again, definitely I will choose the same hotel. Hoping I will see the same two persons that make my family trip more pleasant."
"1564","The only negative review is regarding the night entratainment. Some of the programs depending on the day should be specified to be for adults only. We took our two girls to see some night shows on different days and we end it up leaving the theater due to inapropiate language or body movements. "
"1565","Lovely place to stay. Nice clean rooms"
"1566","Good staff. Close to the famous Ladies Beach. Nice pool. Good value for money! "
"1567","Rooms are getting a bit outdated. Needs a restoration. "
"1568","The staff were really friendly and helpful.  There is a lovely ambience and friendly feeling in the Generator Hostel, Great Decor aswell."
"1569","detestable ""suite junier"", one side view on the antennas other side view on the road full of motors !!"
"1570","On check-in the staff were very friendly and efficient. The staff in the Castaway Bar were lovely, very helpful and welcoming. "
"1571","On the night of our stay (Friday 21 June) there was a fire in the early hours. My daughter and I had a very scary moment when we were coming down the stairs towards the fire exit and could clearly smell smoke. I was surprised that there didn't seem to be anyone in charge when we were waiting outside the hotel. There were too many people under the front canopy for us to shelter from the rain there, so we took shelter in a doorway, but I couldn't see anybody taking a roll call and, if there was, they certainly didn't bother to come to us. I only knew the cause of the fire because somebody near me asked a fire officer and when we were allowed back in no explanation was forthcoming from a member of staff. In the morning, when we checked out, no mention was made of the fire! Every friend and colleague I've mentioned it to since has been surprised that I didn't ask for a refund but I think at the least I could have expected an apology for a very disturbed night. My daughter was rather shaken by the experience and it left us very tired for our busy day on Saturday. It's such a shame because I liked the hotel and the staff, but they didn't seem prepared for an emergency. "
"1572","The staff were extremely helpful in particular the girl who we checked in with she was great. Breakfast was good although it was not all you can eat as we had to order it."
"1573","The room was really dusty could have done with a more thorough clean. Abit disappointing"
"1574","we had a very enjoyable stay in the hotel staff were very nice and helpful .breakfast vas very good ..restaurant was a bit expensive for dinner but was lovely .overall a very nice hotel to say in will visit it again."
"1575","Beautiful accommodation with high standards of cleanliness, rooms serviced every day with fresh towels.  Gorgeous pool area and food and drinks reasonable priced  The staff very helpful with queries and called taxis when needed and offered early check in.  Fantastic! "
"1576","It's 10mins drive into centre and not feasible walking so a bit misleading in review. No problem as it was perfect accommodation just would have like to have been prepared.   The complex definitely needs a super market or on site shop because if distance from centre.   "
"1577","Arrived in London in the morning and knew our room would not be ready but introduced ourselves and the lady receptionist was super spoiling the grandchildren and allowing to park so we could go off and explore London,  Room was spotlessly clean,"
"1578","When we did book in later that day the reception was busy and the gentleman receptionist was a bit harassed and did not explain very well where our rooms were,  would of liked hot drinks in room,"
"1579","nice hotel and i like very much would want to live there again."
"1580","An amazing view from the top of the hotel. Its also in a good location, with good facilities nearby. The hotel room was cleaned regular, and staff generally friendly."
"1581","The air conditioning in the hotel pretty much dosen't work. You'll need to complain and get a fan from reception or deal with 28 degree heat in bed. Try and get a sea view as our small box indoor view was just that. Having a sea view and a balcony door will probaly make the hotel a much more pleasant stay. "
"1582","Only problem that my girlfriend said was the bathroom doors are see through, which she did not like."
"1583","Staff were very friendly and helpful"
"1584","Our room was dirty and we had to he moved. "

"1589","Location is good. Good value for money."
"1590","After all the negative reviews we were worried about the hotel but were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. The staff were fine, the room was clean and the pool area had a good view over the sea. Reviews said there were thefts from the rooms so we got a safety deposit box behind the desk for 15 euros and had no problems."
"1591","By the pool you get harassed by shot girls and people asking you to buy drinks/food all day. They also let people selling bar crawls etc into the pool area where you get harassed even further when you just want to relax."
"1592","Hotel needs a refit the rooms are very tired and the furniture is dirty and stained, the sink in the bathroom we stayed was cracked, no hairdryer, the ceiling light had three bulbs one was not working and there was a huge cobweb linking the bulbs, the carpet in the room was just minging....and all the edges of the dated furniture were caked in dust, and whoever chose the depressing pictures in the room must be a nutter      "
"1593","A very comfortable and elegant hotel "
"1594","needs to revamp a bit looking a little tired in some areas"
"1595","Excellent value for the money.  Plentiful breakfasts (range of hot and cold foods, drinks, breads, small cakes and fresh fruit) even if it would get boring after several days.  Room and bathroom spotless with easy hot shower.  Reception staff generally helpful. Hair dryers available at desk. Position perfect - 15 mins walk max to Main Square in old town.  3 restaurants including vegetarian almost next door. Supermarket only 5 mins away."
"1596","In hot weather, windows need to be open and traffic noise can be bad at night since hotel at a junction with buses/trams stopping too. Bottled water provided in room on first day.  Pity this was not every day."
"1597","Great location with affordable, undercover parking. Management are First Class (responded to minor food issue promptly). Best value hotel in immediate area. (I've tried 5 others in this location in the last 18 months) Will use again."

"1599","Very expensive, nice as a treat!"
"1600","We had a good time in this hotel.  Everything was very good.  We will tell this to everyone who wants to visit Londen.  We both will come back at this hotel."
"1601","uncomplicated, near my destination, we had a very good offer of hotelopia, the normal prize is to expensive for this house"
"1602","not enough breakfast food at just 8:30, no eggs, no butter etc. We had to ask for every little bread. The reason was not enough personal."
"1603","Very friendly and helpful staff throughout. We had dinner which was excellent both in quality and presentation.  Bed very comfy and very quiet for good sleep."
"1604","My single room was cold, dark and depressing. I found it very clausthrophic .The T.V was old fashioned and very bad reception. I could not see any Air-conditioning in the bathroom and there was no bath. There were two chairs but no table. I would not have stayed any longer than one night in that particular room. "
"1605","Courtesy attitude of staffs and bell boys  Also adequate facilities in rooms  Overall, room was comfortable,and good location with well transports"
"1606","Inadequate cleaning before check in.  Dirty kitchen without cleaning and been drinking water can be founded when we arrive the room.  Also the elevator always cannot react by the room card?I thought that it was the problem of card sensor."
"1607","Good location, near lots of shops and restaurants. Nice service. Very clean."
"1608","Bed was uncomfortable. Room was quite warm and could not change temperature. Repairmen had to enter room for maintenance duing our stay."
"1609","Il Mulino and STK were fantastic!"
"1610","The hotel is desperately in need of upkeep and maintenance."
"1611","Lovely room 2 x double beds with additional room with sofa "
"1612","Convenient location, well presented, nice rooms, firendly and professional staff"
"1613","Room was very warm when we returned in the evening and outside was too noisy to leave the window open."
"1614","Good location, and nice room"
"1615","Over-priced with respect to similar hotels and bars.  Your website said the hotel had internet.  It did not..other than purchasing an access card from a boutique which was never open.  The price of internet was ridiculous ($9 per hour) which is unheard of anywhere else on the globe.  I cant return until there is internet as my businesses suffer significantly without communication.  Front desk staff were difficult at times and we always felt like prices were escalating here and there.  For example the exchange rate would be 0.87 one day and then 0.80 the next day.  We would challenge this and the clerk would revert to the better rate!!! (how does that work?).  The hotel has not maps and not much help in planning a day of sightseeing.      "
"1616","Very good location, close to the public transportation "
"1617","Carpet should be renew."
"1618","A basic clean hotel. I found the manager and his wife very friendly and helpful. The Hotel was as we expected for the price we paid."
"1619","Good value for money. Only 20 min to St Marco"
"1620","Personnel very friendly and accommodating. Comfortable bed. Quiet environment. Separate bedroom very much appreciated when two couples in unit. Outstanding breakfast. Well equipped kitchenette. Convient location."
"1621","Pool hours. Would be nice to close à 10:00pm instead of 8:00pm. TVs could be replaced with flat screens."
"1622",NA
"1623","Very good Hotel, nice and clean, the staff were very friendly,welcoming and helpful. Great location, Would stay here again,"
"1624","    Great location for theatres, river, shopping and 'doing London'.  It says what it does on the tin!"
"1625","Bit of noise overnight but what would you expect in London?"
"1626","Value for money, breakfast included. Central location.  Very close to transportation, when moving on to next location  while travelling. Clean linen."
"1627","Too many stairs when travelling with large ports. No help available, no lift.  Building over railway station and shook with vibration from trains journeying thru station. Reception staff communicated incorrect times for breakfast, so was unable to obtain a cooked one. Kitchen staff did apologise for the mix up though. Room needs brighting up and though beds were clean were a bit old. Poor quality pillows. But still value for the money paid,"
"1628","The staff in the restaurant was extremely friendly and accomodating."
"1629","At 3am we were woken up by people talking loadly and banging.  At 3:30am I called reception and asked them to shut the noise down.  The next morning when I asked whether I enjoyed my stay, I explained what had happened and asked for compensation.  I was told that the hotel is not responsible and would not provide any compensation.  The don't care attitude was extremely disappointing.  I would not recommend this hotel, it is overprised and the carpets in the hall and rooms are very dirty."
"1630","The staff were very friendly and they spoke English"
"1631","Located in the heart of London, in the prestigious Portman Square, The Hyatt Regency Churchill offers a high standard of basic facilities both in room and and throughout the hotel.  Although like so many London buildings built in that era, the exterior is architecturally unattractive, however he hotel's interior has been renovated to a high standard of opulence without gilding the lilly.    SMOKING ROOMS AVAILABLE!!!!! Nothing worse than not being able to do the things one can at home when away    The staff were professional, friendly and polite!   The Food was, as expected, Hyatt's usual world class standard.  24 Hour (paid) Parking is available  We certainly recommend it for a business or shopping trip to London! "
"1632","Nice and quite , lovely views , spacious appts. and very nice helpfull staff.  Hotel is about 15 - 20 min driving to Puerto Banus and Marbella which reasonably accepted."
"1633","Large room, great view on river Clyde, iMac in room, extremly good value for money"
"1634","in the outskirts of Glasgow (but ideal to visit Auchentoshan distillery), about 20 min by car to city centre"
"1635","Everyone to everything was a dream come true.  If ever there was to be another great value to stay at this resort I would  jump at the opportunity."
"1636","Room was badly maintained  Booked a castle room and they placed us at the hotel lodge and refused to change booking  Food and drink were overly expensive  Staff were rude and unhelpful  Headboard fell out of the wall in the middle of the night  Late check in time  Early check out time  "
"1637","Lovely hotel with a great location. Happy and friendly staff and a wonderful pool complex"
"1638","Close to the centre of london."
"1639","Friendly and helpful stuff. They helped us to change the room because it was so high noise level on our floor. Nice view from the rooms!"
"1640","So much noise in the night/early morning, because all this groups! So it was hard to have à sleep. The beds were very hard, not comfortable at all."
"1641","Very comfortable beds; central location; kitchen and laundry facilities in room."
"1642","Pleased with room "
"1643","Noisy in the night-think there was a group of men on a stag weekend which woke me up at 4am on Sunday morning"
"1644","The hotel can be good if a better management takes care of it especialy cleanness, facility, staff conduct, and braekfast."
"1645","1. I found that the reception staff had a problem with booking from internet agency and that only certain rooms can be given.  2. the room is not clean at all especailly the bath room. The housekeeper though nice did not have time to do it as she said.  3. If you want to rest and relax this is not your hotel as so much noise later at night.  4. the room has so many mosquitos and other insects. Be raedy to be itching all the time.  5. TV: few local channels.  6. braekfast. I advise to do without it. Almost nothing two days in arow in 2 different times. The second time I found the dishes that supposed to be clean are very dirty with food left on them and put as clean dishes. The person working there is very unclean. I left the place once I saw the dishes.  7. Elevator: simply does not work.  It is a pitty this hotel has a nice location and some rooms with nice views but with worst services and faciolities and realy unclean. I wounder how it could be 4 stars. This is misleading and you might want to mention this to whom it may concern. I have much more to say but all negative so this is enough."
"1646","very central; lovely balconies overlooking all the action. Extremely kind and helpful staff."
"1647","The hotel has a great view to the ocean and its own Marina."
"1648","Where do I begin? 5 stars, what a joke. First of all the ""all- inclusive"" package is not all-inclusive. The restaurants and cafes the hotel claims to have are in fact private and cost extra. This is only made clear upon arrival which was very decieving!!! There are so many extra costs that they can't be listed. The service is horrible! Most of the staff are about 16 years old and have no idea how to provide quality service. Throughout the hotel I found only two personnel who could speak English. The food that was all inclusive was edible, but that is about it. The buffet was always the same, the food being recycled from day to day and becoming old which you could taste. Do not go to this hotel expecting 5 stars...3 stars is more appropriate. "
"1649","good sized standard room for single. very clean. good wifi. affordable rates. near food and transportation. cool courtyard to relax with friends and drinks."
"1650","limited parking. only 2 at one time in front of the hotel. mrt working nearby so u get confusing roads and signboard."
"1651","For ~55 euros a night it was a great value for money. polite personel. location is superb and great vistas across the sea. very quiet. if you use the hotel only for sleeping, it is a good choice"
"1652","Not suitable for kids and families, although did provide baby cot when requested one. lifts work until 22.00, not all places have access with lifts. lift to the beach not working. tv not working. wifi not working in the rooms.arrived for brekfast 30 minutes before closing and were limited options to choose from e.g. no eggs.  poor facilities."
"1653","The staff is very nice but did not feel like a respectful guest - more like someone who had to be treated nice in order to keep their job. Generally, the food was made without affection and corresponded to a two-star tourist hotel. Very noisy restaurant because staff cleaned tables and used large garbage trolleys in front of people eating quietly. Stressful. Cooking chef in restaurant had fingers and nails of that of a car mechanic - no immediate effect when told to the manager."
"1654","Great location."
"1655","They charged me extra  80 Dirham for 2 nights  and I was not aware of the charge when booked "
"1656","its a nice hotel to stay."
"1657","the hotel is overpriced in relation with its quality."
"1658","Many pools including a lagoon. Good quality shops and resturants although a little expensive. Great health food shop next to tapas tower pool. 4 water slides in 1 pool was graet addition for kids and or adults. Close to Alamona shopping centre largest outdoor shopping centre in the world, massive food court. Fire works display every Friday night.    "
"1659","Great location, clean and spacious rooms, good food and a very nice and a very friendly and courteous personell. guided tour to the Ganga arti which was wonderful. What more can I say. This hotel does not disappoint you."
"1660","The staff were excellent, working long hours but always with a smile and a good word. The continental breakfast far exceeded other hotels, that I have stayed in. Yes, it has the basics but the chef also put an extra on each morning so I can't understand others that complain about it. Request a sea view room with balcony and you couldn't  ask for more...the view is fantastic. This hotel is certainly value for money."
"1661","The internet is expensive and very bad!"
"1662","The room are clean and good arrangement."
"1663","Difficulty to get car park, swimming pool not suitable for kid and can't extend check out time even one hour."
"1664","The hotel is really lovely and our room was superb, and it was lovely that they took note of my request for a quiet room as it was for my husbands birthday and they even left a card and a lovely little bottle of wine all wrapped up for him - that was a lovely touch.  The evening meal was excellent and great value - wine list good too and not overly priced for a hotel of this quality"
"1665","Good breakfast and not much to moan about!"
"1666","Bath towels too small and no fan / aircon made the room stuffy.  Parking should be included in the package.   I don't expect to pay to park when I stay at hotels!  It's a Ryanair  of doing business that finds every chargeable extra to levy on Customers who have little choice at the time.  You may be losing business by charging for parking but may attract more if you advertise it as FREE.  I can understand having to pay for holiday long stay but a real put-off for a one nighter!"
"1667","Friendly staff! Nice view! Very clean hotel! Everyone is attentive! It's a lot of stars! Very very good!"
"1668","There appeared to be a lot of stains on the carpets throughout the corridors also the internal doors within the apartment could really do with some kind on latch on them as they bang like mad.    "
"1669","the room was very small and had no drawyers to put things in, also only a tiny wardrobe. one of the bed lamps was loose and the electricity socket where the kettle plugs in was also loose.  "
"1670","Fantastic staff especially shuana and the rest of the bar staff would definitely book to stsy there again "
"1671","some of staff a bit rude"
"1672","nothing really. Not enough boiled potatoes to many chips."
"1673","Clean.  Reception staff welcoming.  Hotel bar charges for food/drinks/tea/coffee etc very, very reasonable prices for a hotel. E.g. cup of coffee 1.60 euro (hotel) v 1.50 euro (beach cafe)"
"1674","Disappointed that there was no tea/coffee making facility within hotel room.  Could be order/bought in hotel bar at reasonable "
"1675","Excellent staff, good level of cleanliness, good exterior territory, comfortable and friendly atmosphere."
"1676","Room attendants , bar staff , lounge staff and restaurant staff very friendly and polite .  Superb breakfast , executive lounge very good at happy hour 6-8pm with nibbles and drinks .  Executive check in very good .  Roof top pool superb with good staff ."
"1677","Front end staff at main reception very frosty , a few niggles at the hotel , staff try very hard but I feel that the management team let the hotel down and need a good shake up ."
"1678","Bright sunlight in the morning, I would recommend a sleep mask and maybe earplugs for an excellent nights sleep.  Dodgy lock given to me for the locker."
"1679","One of the best hotels I have stayed in, all staff are so friendly,"
"1680","Nothing negative to say,"
"1681","Warm welcome and friendly staff.Complimentary glass of champagne is a lovely touch.Great location and wouldn't need to look anywhere else to stay."
"1682","swimming pool   situation in namaa bay"
"1683","A beautiful hidden paradise very near to the beach, supermarket. Away from noise and crowds. The dolmus to Bodrum passes by in front of the hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpfull and most of them speak English. The breakfast is very good with a large variety of food. They also have a Greek/Turkish restaurant wich I haven't tried. All the rooms are situated around the pool. I loved it there. "
"1684","Good location with functional rooms and a great breakfast. Friendly staff"
"1685","Very nice hotel, well situated in the city, friendly staff, excellent pizza baker! "
"1686","No WIFI in the rooms"
"1687","Booked a privilege room, really worth the money! Private terrace area to eat away from the hussle and bussle in the restaurant, free entrance to spa area, private area with private sun lounges by the pool, complementary fresh beach towels given to you each day.   The hotel itself was lovely, deep swimming pool which not found often nowadays, quiet, relaxing.   Only a 5 minute walk to the beach. Quite a far distance from BCN airport (average 1hr20 on coach)   Food was a buffet so a wide variety of choice, from spaghetti, pizza and fish to salad, fresh fruit and vegetables. "
"1688","Staff in the restaurant do not speak much English, much confusion about drinks served in the evening. Just to clarify that you do have to pay for your drinks. Although our first night we were not billed for a bottle of wine when I asked for a glass however my boyfriend was charged for his beer.     And if you order any food during the daytime from the bar area the staff do not tell you that you have to take the receipt yourself to the kitchen area. Sat for 40mins waiting for our food to be then told by a waiter who spoke a little English that we didn't take the receipt so the chef doesn't know about the food order. "
"1689","Everything you expect"
"1690","Had to pay a lot for parking even with the discount. Also had to organise my booking when arrived as it haven't been done correctly and cost me £9 in calls from a mobile."
"1691","It is simply SUPERB and stunning. Very clean and beautiful location. Would go again"
"1692","Gem of a hotel, staff very pleasant, helpful and Professional sorted a problem out with our  toilet within a couple of hours most apologetic would definitely go again and most certainly recommend it."
"1693","Nice lunch and breakfast. Very frendly staff. Very clean romms and public area."
"1694","Dinner not soo good. Almost the same food as lunch - but it is not dinner."
"1695","brilliant location for concert and shopping!!!!Car park available and this was an added plus for me."
"1696","The hotel was very nice, yes the rooms are a little smaller than I have come to expect however, I was there for the sunshine and the beach so it was of little importance."
"1697","I have to say this hotel is one of the best hotels I have been in  Very clean very new and friendly stuff and good location A     "
"1698","Very central location right near bus and train stations. Excellent value for money - I have stayed here previously and would definitely stay again!  "
"1699","We only stayed for one night but would definately recommend it to family and friends.  We arrived in the middle of a wedding but the reception staff could not have been more helpful.  They put us in a beautiful room far away from the wedding so it would not be noisy for us.  I had read some not so complimentary reviews on Trip Adviser as was slightly worried but I do not know what rooms these people stayed in as ours was clean, very well furnished and the bed and bedding were superb.  We will certainly book this hotel again."
"1700","nice atmosphere"
"1701","just menu for room services is very bad"
"1702","The best green site in Windhoek!   Professional and friendly staff. Better service than most direct competitor hotel in Windhoek."
"1703","Shuttle prices to city and airport."
"1704","Very good location. Very clean. Good price/quality."
"1705","No airco in the room. Quality of breakfast can be better."
"1706","Brilliant central location, nice quiet rooms, large super- kingsize beds, good bathrooms and powerful shower. Staff so polite, efficient and willing to help with anything including reservations for restaurants and airport taxi shuttle which is very reasonably priced.  Minutes from the beautiful Danube river, hotel is in lovely art deco building, inside its quite alternative and very modern. The bedrooms have giant mirrors with tv incorporated inside them. Beds are a tiny bit hard but it di not stop us having a great night sleep. The place is truly immaculate. Breakfast are good and served until the civilised time of 10.30am. The staff even let us keep the room for late check out. We could not have asked for more. Its a very boutique style and definetley something different. 5 stars! and Highly reccomended"
"1707","perhaps a sun terrace would be nice."
"1708","Rooms are excellent, confortable, clean etc. Staff very friendly. "
"1709","exactly as advertised, we stayed here last year and returned without hesitation"
"1710","Breakfast very poor, items on buffet menu not available on buffet table, also bacon almost cold, sausages overlooked,fresh fruit salad consisted of melon only. Breakfast is served until 10.00 we went down between 8.30 and 9.00 so we were not late going."
"1711","Nice managment on beach.  Good manner of all stuff.  Well prepared room equiptment."
"1712","I found the staff generally helpful and friendly: the room was modern, clean and very pleasant overlooking the garden. The Bedford is an excellent central place to stay in London"
"1713","I had an evening meal in the restaurant. The vegetarian dish was almost inedible.  Service at breakfast is erratic."
"1714","Hotel is nice and in a great location, the room was large and clean."
"1715","We stayed at the Hotel Del Consoli so after check in we had to walk to our actual hotel. It is rather confusing having to check in at one hotel and then make your  to another carrying all your luggage. There is a reception desk at the hotel so not sure why this cant be used when there expecting people checking in."
"1716","the hotel room had no view to speak about. maintenance needed in the room. a little more attention to cracked paintwork "
"1717","Much russian people, but were not a problem"
"1718","I stayed in this hotel for 3 days 4 night and truly speaking it was wonderful experience. It was delicious food, Great Room Service, excellence rooms and pool.its well furnished with white colour n great for whole love white specially me. It is located in beach. Staff is very friendly and caring...We will definitely have our next stay here in near December.the park holiday beach resort see you soon.Thanks for care.Regards,HUSAIN SONI"
"1719","My wife and I spent eight days (June 2013) at Hotel Hacienda Puerta del Sol, near Mijas. This is a 4* hotel, so we weren't expecting luxury or fine dining. The hotel was super clean, staff very friendly/helpful. 'Reception staff' spoke excellent English. Breakfast and dinner was buffet style and quantity/quality/choice was really good. There was a good choice of wines/alcoholic drinks at exceptionally reasonable prices.     The hotel is in a scenic area. It is quiet - average age of guest 55  (although a few young couples/families were there during our stay). The hotel trades heavily on bus tours with an overnight stay/early depart. This is an advantage to other guests as the hotel/poolside is never congested and it is easy to get a sunbed by the pool. There is no loud music anywhere in hotel (even around the pool in daytime) -a massive plus! No-one diving into pool either - so you can relax and enjoy the sun. There was no entertainment at night when we were there but guests enjoyed evening drinks on the terrace after dinner and basically chilled out.    A car is a must if you want to take trips around the area. The hotel is not well sited for walking. Mijas, by car, is five minutes away. There is a regular bus service during the day to Mijas/Fuengirola - leaves from side of hotel and costs a few euro.    In conclusion, this hotel is ideal for a quiet, relaxing, peaceful holiday in very pleasant surroundings.   "
"1720","The beds/mattresses in the hotel are basic (but very clean). There is some tolerable (unless you are neurotic!) road noise during the day which can be heard in the gardens/ pool area, as the side of the hotel is close to the main road from Fuengirola to Mijas. Traffic lessens in the evening and the noise disappears.    There is an absence of notices (or badly placed notices) advertising hotel services eg that Wi Fi is available, where pool towels can be obtained etc.  "
"1721","Very pleasant hotel in good location for Valetta. Short transfer to airport."
"1722","Lovely well kept hotel in nice surroundings. Helpful pleasan staff,  Anniversary night away and we were upgraded to a suite which was   Brilliant thank you ."
"1723","Nothing negatives to say."
"1724","The hotel was well located. Room was spacious. Staff very friendly."
"1725","Improvement in cleaniness required as previous occupiers belongings found under bed by cleaner which should not have happened. Coffee facility inadequate. Mini bar and breakfast over priced. Car parking fees need to reduced."
"1726","Good value for money. Staff very proofessional who provided a ***** stars service (carry bags to the room, hold the door, get you a taxi...etc). Very helpful and smiling. Just a pleasure!  Place and rooms clean properly and sheet changed everyday. Also get every morning around 9:45am a free shuttle that goes to a beach. Internet access is free and very speed! Airport is at about 15min driving by taxi (don't get a white taxi as they're the most expensive!!!). Restaurant close from the hotel. At the gas station (5min walks to the right) you'll find two cash machin if needed (one inside and one outside). And the city center is at about 15:20min driving! Taxi are cheap so not a problem to be out of the touristic zone."
"1727","The hotel is far away from the touristic zone, in what they call ''the old town"" in the Indian/Pakistan area. On arrival at the hotel for the check in, they kept our passeport for no reason. 4 night clubs on the ground floor...so a bit noisy on the evening. Was on floor 4 so wasn't disturbing that much for us. Also unable to have a guest coming in your room without the authorisation of the reception guys (ID needs to be shown!). Felt really bad for my friends who came over in our room to get a glass of water. Staff followed us to the floor, then knocked at the door to ask our guest to get out the room and stop by the reception for an ID check. "
"1728","Location was excellent, It is cheap and good value for money paid."
"1729","Basically needed a good paint in the rooms - good clean around with disinfectant to freshen up"
"1730","Very friendly and efficient staff, always smiling and very pleasant  Room was very modern, clean. Staff would constantly be checking if   You required fresh towels or bottles of water. They were very happy to assist.    Great views all around hotel.    Food was was good and there was a good selection.  Dinner served till 11pm, this was good as you didn't have to rush back to hotel.    Free shuttle service to mall was good - make sure you get to pick up point early as this  Service is efficient and runs precisely on schedule!    Excellent hotel, clean, friendly staff great beach and pool area."
"1731","Quite simply the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Truly awful in every possible "
"1732","For €77,- it was just okay, not good and not awfull.  The normal price is around €120,- and that's  too expensive for this quality."
"1733","Dirty sheets, a lot of stains in the carpet.   Bed not very comfortable and just horrible pillows!"
"1734","Very clean and well maintained "
"1735","TV was horrible /limited cable stations   Breakfast foods were not that good "
"1736","There is nothing to do in San Agustin.     The mattress was very hard. "
"1737","Great hotel with brilliant facilities.  Very child friendly and ideal for families."
"1738","Pillows could be better and television a bit bigger. Also they had some new towels and not washed enough, so the peels/cloth was all over my body and because the towel was so new it did not dry."
"1739","found the hotel to be very pleasant and clean. staff on the whole were acceptable but wish they would smile. I know its probably their culture but very off putting"
"1740","Very kind and helpfull personals. Nearby city and nearby underground. "
"1741","We arrive the hostel 5 min before closing. But it take one hour before we get any room because of hotelopia. Our room was not booked from hotelopia, and the personal have a problem with allready booked rooms. so thank you staff that fixed it for us. I will never book trough Hotelopia again..... "
"1742","New-clean-location-staff"
"1743","We booked superior room. Excellente. View on a ocean. The best decision. Other rooms are back in the hill with no view at all.   You have a nice beach 70 meters away from the hotel. A nice power walk cus its downhill and back uphill. On the right side of the beach you can explore the near village. Good beach.   Bus stop directly at the beach and you can visit Mahe.     Hotel has also Other hotels on the other islands. You can island hoop them arranged free of charge of hotel if you exchange sleep over during your stay. For Praslin, For La Digue you need to add some money.  La Digue the best island, but hardcore waves. Praslin also nice. Mahe also nice :)    Hotel Restaurant: very good food. Prices better than any other Restaurant. "
"1744","Nice simple and small hotel close to the beach and the city. Hospitality and service are given in a pleasant . A good place to be."
"1745","Extremely unprofessional staff-rooms were not clean and even the doors were unfunctional-I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone."
"1746","Hotel is in good location - Maspalomas, tons of activities. And Jumbo center entrance. Friendly staff. Good food. "
"1747","To the hotel: Please, write a warning, about TONS of GAY'S is visiting and living you'r hotel. I was with my wife, and it's not very nice, that i did'nt find anywhere info about gays activities.   Small pool. Hotel is old, and I don't think now it's 4 stars. Thank you, and good luck."
"1748","Being frequent travelers - always return via this hotel in Bangkok - we enjoy our stay here so much!  World class!"
"1749","It's always a pleasure to stay in your hotel. The location is absolutely one of the best in the city. It is very easy to get around from the Sabana. I really liked your updates. It has been a few years since I last traveled to Costa Rica.I was not disappointed by my stay at your hotel. The prices are still great, the rooms comfortable, the breakfast excellent, the parking garage a real bonus, the security top notch and the staff helpful. Thanks for changing our room to a downstairs one due to my difficulty with stairs. The French soccer group although slightly unpleasant were just being French and at least were interesting. The other groups and guests from several countries were delightful and friendly.  We had a great time. Thanks for remaining one of the very best hotels in Costa Rica.     "
"1750","The building is wonderful - historic house owned by the Queen Mother's father.  Furnishings etc are extremely fine.  The location is excellent and quiet.  Staff were extremely helpful and professional.  Breakfast plentiful."
"1751","London rooms are small, but this was RIDICULOUS.  Partner had to sit on the bed just to allow me enough space to edge sideways around it.  Due to the size of the room there were no facilities like an ironing board - just as well as it would not be possible to put it up.  The room was prone to be hot so we slept with the window open - the only air conditioning would be from an electric fan which was in the cupboard serving as a wardrobe (which I had to sit in to put on my shoes as there was no space anywhere else!), and I cannot see where it could hope to be plugged in without overbalancing.  This is only a 4* hotel due to having a concierge desk and 24 hour reception.  Better described as a nice 3*"
"1752","Staff and the hotel complex itself was excellent.  Beatifully landscaped gardens and close to the beach and Porec town.  Very calm and safe environment for families with enough facilities (massage, gym, indoor outdoor pools etc) that there was plenty to do.  Breakfast was really fantastic."
"1753","The beach and particularly the sea closest to the hotel was dirty with a significant amounts of litter (plastic bags etc) but also see weed washing up on the beach each day.  It was occasionally cleaned away by the staff but not frequently enough.  The water might not contain polluntants (blue flag) but the litter was really an issue so in the end we found a nice pebble beach 10m drive up the road that was much better."
"1754","Absolutely beautiful hotel, clean and extremely professional staff. A     food.  Great location in Jumeriah Beach (construction going on across the road but this didn't have any impact on sleeping or other activities).  Would highly recommend to everybody, extremely happy with the quality and service received."
"1755","An excellent apart hotel with friendly staff, good facilities and a high quality of cleanliness. My studio room was large, well equiped with air conditioning and daily maid service. I stayed on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast was very good ranging from continental to an English fried menu. Ideally situated for the Strip in Albufeira and close to many good bars and restaurants."
"1756","Unfortunately my stay was spoilt by the rowdiness and unacceptable behaviour of large groups of 'British' youngsters staying at the hotel, clearly intent on enjoying themselves at the expense of other guests. The hotel and/or holiday companies MUST address this issue as I am sure that returning holidaymakers to Albufeira will avoid this and other hotels that continue to accept bookings from large groups of young idiots."
"1757","Hard to find - better signage nearby and instructions online would help."
"1758","A handrail in the pool (villa) would be great, as it is difficult to get out of"
"1759","Very nice almost new apartments, very clean, nice balconies (yes 2 in our case), lovely gardens, free aircon (it was hot at night in early June), nice pleasant helpful owners, Short stroll to pebbly beach, town "
"1760","For the price we were super pleasantly surprised. After 5 nights in a turtle bay beach cottage we picked this as a low cost option but it was fantastic. Perfect location, less busy but gorgeous beach out front, quick walk to main shopping strip, bars and restaurants in the building and block, supermarket and coffee downstairs, bus around the corner... Comfy king size bed, perfectly clean bathroom. Will definitely stay again! "
"1761","Nothing. Didn't go check out the pool since beach is across the road!"
"1762","Good position to tourist attractions and shopping. Very friendly and cooperative staff."
"1763","It was a very pleasant experience to be guest at the Manukan Island resort! Everything was just fine."
"1764","Everything about this hotel worked well for us and we would definitively return. Represented great value for money. My parents endorse this positive response who also stayed at the same time . The hotel was very clean in all respects.The staff are extremely efficient, friendly and helpful. It's a great location with a lovely atmosphere and we all felt  very safe and secure there.  The hair dryer is nice and powerful . Next time there will be no need to bring our own hair dryer."
"1765","Great location in the heart of Madrid. Rooms stay cool even in heat of day, plus the history of the hotel adds to the ambience of it all (1862). Staff was helpful and spoke English (so my bad Spanish wasn't a problem). Restaurant was great, fast service and good food ( you could tell by the locals there)."
"1766","Elevator (lift) wasn't always operating at its best; bar down street was noisy (but hey, it's Spain and part of the local flavor) as I heard it from my room."
"1767","The only view was of a large ducting pipe outside in a very narrow outside space within the confines of the hotel"
"1768","very good entertainments at the pool, professional animators, very good place to go on holiday with children."
"1769","no negative emotions :)"
"1770","Really eased with how attentive staff were, particularly the phone call 5 mins after settling into our room to check it was all ok."
"1771","Could do with having safes in each room rather than just a few safety deposit boxes behind reception."
"1772","Nice bed and pillows"
"1773","Parking too expensive"
"1774","Let us have late check out at 5pm with no xtra charge.  Very nice new, clean and large room with free upgrade"
"1775","This was an amazing value for my money. The place was roomy with a large kitchen/living area. The tub was huge in the master bedroom. Everything was amazing with minor hiccups. My friends and I didn't want to leave our little paradise in Kissimmee. "
"1776","The toilet outside the guest bedroom had a mind of its own and decided if it did not want to flush or not. But not a huge problem. The setup for the apts was a little strange. If I'm in apt m-19, it can't be accessed in the same hallway as apt m-4 (just an ex). I wish I could just walk across like regular apartments. And lastly, there's no door between the master tub and the master bedroom so if I have a guest in the master tub, I can see them from my bed. All very minute problems that had very little impact on the great time I had here, just things I noticed. "
"1777","Hotel well situated only 2 subway stations away from central Catalunya place. Helpful and kindly staff willing to make you feel like at home. Affordable room rate, high quality breakfast, comfortable beds and clean room. Only 2 stars hotel but it definitely deserves a 3rd one..    Gracia area, where the hotel is located, is a nice area to walk in or eat something. I strongly recommend you this spanish restaurant, great food only a few meters away from the hotel :  http://www.tripadvisor.de/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d2719760-Reviews-La_Porteria-Barcelona_Catalonia.html  "
"1778","Noisy and busy street in front of hotel but we could sleep well nevertheless. Painting in the room could have been refreshed and a small furniture was missing in the bathroom to put our things on"
"1779","The hotel is in an excellent location near the city center so you don't need a car during the evening."
"1780","The hotel did not have beach towels for the swimming pool which is surprising for a 4 star hotel"
"1781","Very comfortable bed"
"1782","The hotel is very much in service of your needs. Food is plenty and staff is uber friendly"
"1783","To our taste, it was a bit too touristy, catering to large groups. For couples you might want somewhat more intimacy, not eating at the buffet everyday (breakfast, lunch and dinner). Extra's would cost you big time - like going for an intimate dinner (45 USD p.p. extra), picking you up from the airstrip (45 USD  p.p (one way) - and there being no other  to get there). "
"1784","Near Paddington station"
"1785","They demanded to borrow £10 for security reasons. We shall get it back one day. Noisy.  Never again."
"1786","Loved the gardens and animals our 2 year old was in heaven, loved the size of the rooms and the swimming pools view from room of rainbow tower."
"1787","Too many rooms based of one infastructure I.e check in took forever, outdated movie system, no kettle in room or champagne glasses or milk, walk to the happening part of town. Only little things... We did really enjoy our stay"
"1788","Nice swimming pool, good location, cheap restaurants just outside the hotel"
"1789","Great location and good for all ages. .  Staff really friendly and hotel very clean.  Had no problems finding sunbeds every day.  .  "
"1790","Food a bit disappointing from the last time we came 4 years ago, but adequate."
"1791"," This 2-night, 3-day stay in your hotel was simply superb! From the moment we arrived until we picked up our bags from the concierge our experiences at every level of service were second to none. Be assured we will be back!"
"1792","None whatsoever!"
"1793","Lovely service. Decor a bit dated but definitely compensated by the service. Have already been back a second time and planning a third visit. "
"1794","Old furnishing, air condition, fridge, safe have to pay extra. Also you can't use the air condition when you are out. Not recommend!!!"
"1795","- on good position, peace  - clean rooms"
"1796","maybe some vegatables could be served on breakfeast (like salad, cucumber,tomato) instead of much sucker pies"
"1797","Not nearly enough sun loungers, food hit and miss, a dress code for dinner which is not adhered to, only very few english speaking guests in hotel."
"1798","Great hotel and very friendly staff. Bright rooms, lovely garden-pool area and very clean. Breakfast buffet has a good variety of breads, cereals, fruits and sandwich fillings."
"1799","The bed mattrasses are very hard. A Ikea Sultan topper mattrass would make them much more comfortable."
"1800","If the room would be equiped with refrigeretor, it would have, according my opinion, increase the popularity. The maids didn´t clean the room every day, i.e. the sama issue. It is not  complains, just remark."
"1801","Absolutely superb hotel - modern tasteful rooms in old but beautiful building - lovely location.  Terrace restaurant lovely setting and good food.  Superb value for money. If the hotel was in Mardin would be twice the price - but it isn't that far away!"
"1802","Public areas are attractive and location fairly good for The old town. Take bus number 1 or  M  into town.  "
"1803","Room set up for 1 person and we had to request  a second    chair and more towels. TV was old and square.   Bathroom  smelled  damp with  low  quality toiletries. Breakfast orange juice too sweet and artificial taste ."
"1804","Probably the cleanest hotel I've stayed at for a long while. Congrats to the housekeeping staff!"
"1805","Good location - 7 minutes walk from Euston station.  Nice, clean hotel."
"1806","This is a very good resort, on the beach, with good facilities. The Valet Parking is great. The rooms are good, well maintained, and the quality of the infrastructure is good.  Helpful and friendly staff."
"1807","Te Internet is far too expensive, so therefore I didn't use it. Drop the price and I would have paid for it!  The Buffett restaurant is average in quality.  The location of this hotel is excellent for the beach, but a long  from the co of Fujairah."
"1808","The location, food and staffs are good."
"1809","little bit of cleanliness, for double bed two single beds are placed together, room is small according to the star of hotel."
"1810","Very much needs an update, particularly the room"
"1811","Staff- very friendly, professional, always there to greet you   Service- 10/10  always somebody available to help   Overall best hotel I've stayed in 9.5/10"
"1812","Location excellent, cleanliness very good, staff efficient. "
"1813","Water in the mornings was discoloured.   An oven would have been good. "
"1814","Convenient location, reasonable value for money and friendly and helpful staff."
"1815","WiFi not available in room, very limited toiletry items with no facial tissues, face towels or hand towels, thick dust on bathroom door panel and desk drawers."
"1816","The suite 208 was very quiet overlooking the convent. The location of the hotel was also very quiet yet only a short walk from the old town square. Nearby there were plenty of bars and restaurants. The reception staff were friendly and helpful, providing recommendations for eating and drinking. I would certainly stay at this hotel if I was visiting Prague again.  "
"1817","Whilst there was an excellent selection on the breakfast buffet the hot breakfast was not hot, the warming dishes need some attention. There was a charge of 40 CZK per coffee pod in your room, I think this should be complimentary. "
"1818","Polite and friendly staff  Good breakfast and value- for- money reception service "
"1819","Smallest bedroom I have ever encountered in a London hotel "
"1820","The room is very spacious with a big balcony offering a great seaview. The staff at the reception are very friendly and helpful, allowing us to check-in early on arrival at 8 am, and offering us tips and maps on what to see and where to go."
"1821","The breakfast is meagre, orange juice, croissant or cake and coffee."
"1822","Friendly staff, nicely situated. Quiet surroundings. Very nice garden. Supermarket in the neighbourhood. Direct busconnection to the centre."
"1823","From arrival at the main entrance , through the reception  and check in the staff were professional polite and friendly. The hotel from entering exudes a friendly, authentic and calm atmosphere congruous with the anticipated Havana style.    The room was well equiped, clean and perfect for the duration of our stay. The concierge was most obliging and patient when quizzed on the practicalities of travelling around Havana. The restaurants, food and staff could only be described as excellent and this is ignoring the general tourist trade in Havana. The onsite site store and money exchange made for a self contained stay without the requirement to obtain essential supplies elsewhere. Not forgetting the roof top pool and bar which which made the location all the more impressive when admiring the views over Havana.    The main lounge during evening times was impressive with a great bar, fantastic drinks and cigar selection enhanced by the authentic surroundings and professional staff    Overall an excellent hotel and enough to warrant seeking our next vacation at an Iberostar Hotel, somewhere different."
"1824","Over our 2 night , 3 day stay there was nohthng which could be added to improve our stay."
"1825","Good location and friendly staff"
"1826","There was no hot water in our cabana.       There were two ceiling lights in our cabana, neither was working until a staff member was able to manipulate the fluorescent tube and get it working.  This took some time,  after some time "
"1827","Loved the farm in the garden! Excellent breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff. Pleasant south facing patio.  Definitely would stay again."
"1828","friendly an helpful service"
"1829","We arrived at the hotel and with out any warning or notice, we were chucked into a taxi and headed to a new hotel because the pool was broken!   Me and my friends booked this hotel because it was so good the year before, and to have to walk an extra 15 minutes to get to the main strip is pretty annoying! Especially at night it didn't seem safe to walk back, we were forking out for taxis! So overall I'm not happy with the holiday, I thought either you guys or the cosmopolite could have emailed me and perhaps let us choose another hotel rather than bein chucked into a crap hotel! "
"1830","Nice staff.  Good facilities.  No problems at all."
"1831","nice suite with swimming pool, friendly and very helpful staff"
"1832","internet is a catastrophe and does not work most of the time. Would not reccomend this hotel to business  people.  in general there is a lack of proper management."
"1833","very authentic; friendly personnel; good food; good location for fish river canyon."
"1834","Location was excellent although the narrow roads did concern us slightly with the car.   Staff very helpful especially with parking.  "
"1835","Staff on reception and in restaurant very welcoming. "
"1836","Excellent staff, clean and efficient. "
"1837","The rooms were a little warm even with air con, but then again people can always open a window!"
"1838","Friendly staff, and very helpful, rooms were nice had basic essentials that needed. "
"1839","Not a lot of parking only small car park at front "
"1840","The hotel was lovely and was exactly what was described. The room was a little small, however we spent all our time sightseeing. Staff very friendly. Ideal location to sights. "
"1841","nice and clean."
"1842","I asked for a room street side on my booking form   and was put in a room overlooking an ugly car park.  Shift manager didn't check properly and asked how I intended to pay when my bill had been settled online,  Some staff at the front counter seemed pissed to be worling there.  Ugly surrounding."
"1843","Wonderful hotel. Location is great, close to restaurants, shops and the beach. Staff is super friendly and very helpful. "
"1844","Difficult to find it. No visible signs on the ."
"1845","The staff was helpfull and serviceminded."
"1846","Hotel is on the beach, if you are looking for sun see and sand. Compound can be a little noisy, if you are ok with that."
"1847","Carefree atmosphere for children-Very lively evenings-Exellent food-Great service-Unmatchable Guest Care."
"1848","reasonable price, easy to get to"
"1849","The service at La Quinta was excellent , very professional and attentive , the hotel is perfect if you want a quiet and relaxing time , perfectly clean throughout and the food was very good quality and enjoyable ."
"1850","Menorca is a very pleasant and quiet island , but the resort of Cala n Bosch is ok but not particularly special , we have stayed before in Cala Galdana , if this hotel was in that resort it would be perfect !! "
"1851","Efficient, friendly and helpful check-in. Speedy bell-hop service in and out of room. Clean, quiet location. Nice property. Swimming pool lovely.   Free internet that worked ok."
"1852","The TV in the room is old. Phone in bathroom falling off wiring."
"1853","Food (both breakfast and dinner) and Spa was very good. The staff was very profissional."
"1854","Well placed In centre of Nice near Place Massena and close to bus and tram routes-short walk to Old Nice and Promenade des Anglais.  Friendly and attentive staff. Clean. Some refurbishment carried out in last year."
"1855","No air conditioning and en suite facilities can be cramped but perfectly adequate. You would pay much more for these facilities so-on balance-really good value for money."
"1856","Nice and clean , staff very friendly. "
"1857","1) Rudeness of staff at reception    2) Did not get room i ask for at booking - asked for room with bath in quiet area of hotel.  When we got to room it offered it did not have a bath so went to reception "
"1858","The bungalow was nice, we had one of ekstra good quality. Good size and nicely renovated."
"1859","We did not like the evening buffet, so we tried different restaurants in the area instead."
"1860","Many MANY issues with the room.  I've stayed at Showboat many times before and this time was by FAR the worst experience I've ever had.  It will make me think twice before booking another room in this hotel.  The pillows were paper thin, the tv remote didn't work, the electrical outlet is a fire hazard as it spits out any plug you put in it, and the room didn't even have a desk in it.  I've never been in a hotel room which was this disappointing."
"1861","Heating didnt work. They wheeled in a portable heater. This was completely unacceptable so we requested a room change as it was a very cold Melbourne night. I was shivering. The room they moved us to was right next to an elevator so we heard that all night. Seriously, I paid good money for a brick wall view in a room smaller than my bedroom n suburban Melbourne. It is out dated, the carpet was worn. The bathroom flooded everywhere as the shower is only separated by a flimsy curtain. It really was poor form and another reason I am fed up with the rip off that is the Australian Hospitality industry. I would rank this as two stars. It wold have been cheaper and better if we just caught a cab back to the suburbs than waste money here, "
"1862","I really enjoyed the hotel and Graceland experience I would definately recommend it to anyone. "
"1863","very old. no fridge, no safe, you could easy hear the  talking.The door very unsafe"
"1864","Only the food and close to the beach."
"1865","Everything. Dirty. Staff not friendly. 3 times changing to a other room. Still dirty. Never ever again."
"1866","Very satiesfied with my stay and haven`t nothing to complaint at. It`s really a 5 star hotel with good facilities and a nice beach. Will also mention the staff who was serviceminded and friendly. "
"1867","Toilets were filthy.  Shower did not drain.  TV reception was poor.  Most international flights into London arrive in the morning. We arrived at 6.30 only to be charged 60 pounds for an early check in. This hotel needs to acknowledge that people will arrive early and not charge an extra night to check in early. "
"1868","Nice modern good value hotel with good rooms, facilities and good food, its in a good location just out of town with very pleasant surroundings, good transport connections to town centre, but only 15 minute walk  /- !"
"1869","When we arrived at the hotel to check in they couldn't find us on their system which worried me a bit, but they pulled out all the stops to give us a room for the night, and breakfast wasn't included in the price even though the receptionist said it was, which I thought was rare ?"
"1870","Very conveniently located for those travelling by car or coming by group travel. On a ring road outside the tightly packed city, it was a restful oasis. A modern large facility, there is some distance to the rooms, but an economical  stay overall."
"1871","Friendly hotel, lovely facilities, clean "
"1872","Nice in old city every thing is near don.t need taxi even"
"1873","Location and facilities"
"1874","No amex accepted.  Need to ask many times before being able to obtain simple services, such as charging extras into hotel bill for settlement at the end of stay, as hotel operates mostly for groups on all inclusive basis, this is an uncommon request which requires many authorisations from different departments,  so make it clear from the beginning that you will pay at the end in order to avoid delays when checking out if you are independent travel.  No email or contact details to inform hotel of lost and found after my departure, can anyone help me with that?"
"1875","I was pleasantly surprised by Jurys Inn hotel near Heathrow. I basically wanted an hotel, not one that would break the bank, near the airport for an early morning flight. But also links that would take me to central london pretty quickly. Hatton Cross tube station is just round the corner, and has a straight picadilly line connection which doesnt require much changing. But I was surprised at how fresh and new the hotel looked, the room was good, beds comfortable (though i must say the pillows left something to be desired - too soft). The staff were competent and friendly and seemed to know what they were doing. All in all, good experience, and would recommend."
"1876","Great location...very clean ...lovely staff obliged straight away to change the room due to noise outside."
"1877","Our first room located on front of building was very noisy ...."
"1878","staff is very serviceminded, and the rooms, lobby, restaurant, etc, is like living in a fairytale!"
"1879","Guests are mostly Russians, witch behaves incredibly rude, selvish and unpolite in every .  They just push their  through the queue everywhere without caring about anything else.  in front of elevators, buffets, bars, reception, any doors: if there's a Russian coming, whatch out, 'cause they don't!!!"
"1880","Cleaning, animationteam and the lunch at the beachrestaurant!"
"1881","The staff at the pool bar and in the restaurant were not service-oriented. Some of them ignored us and did not take up our orders. It happened serveral times."
"1882","Accommodation King Jason Papos 12th to 26th June.  As a result of the services received at the King Jason justice demands we convey our experiences of the service received.  The success of the King Jason is predominately due to the professionalism of the management and staff particularly Andreas, Maria and the Balinese chef but it was in fact all of the staff.  The management and staff understand fully a service business and each and every guest is treated with great dignity, young or old, of any gender, colour or creed.  The management of the King Jason could be used as consultants for other hotels such is the professionalism demonstrated.  We make this judgment having experienced “premium” hotels such as the Istana in KL, Howard Plaza in Taipei, Sofitel in Melbourne and Shangri La on Sentosa Island Singapore to name but a few.  Further my work history is one of General Management overseeing 1200 employees trying to get all singing from the same song sheet like the staff at the King Jason is not easy to achieve and maintain.  Good food and amenities compliment the service offering and results in high value package.    The above comments were expressed by all other guests we conversed with and there were many.    Overall many thanks for all the kindness shown and wish all stakeholders of the business and all Cypriots much prosperity in future years.    Highest Regards  Veronica and Gerry Walsh   "
"1883","The only let down is the internet service which requires urgent correction as the demand on this facility will only grow with time.    Another constructive comment would the generation of a strong room for luggage with a security tagging procedure(common in many hotels) as this would allow guests to be more comfortable on the last day as a results of some having many hours to kill between vacating room and leaving for flights."
"1884","The purpose of our visit was to meet up with family and also to celebrate my niece's birthday! !  We had a fabulous time and appreciate the welcome package of chocolates and card! Hazel enjoyed her spa treatment which was a birthday gift! The food' staff and room were excellent! We will definitely use the Hotel again!! Hopefully sooner rather than later! Thank you all so much!!   "
"1885","The lobby is grand and the history is really interesting."
"1886","My room smelled like Mildew and the sheets in the bed were damp and seemed like they had not been changed for a long time. The shower leaked all over the floor in the bathroom although the shower pressure was good."
"1887","Good location for visiting and sightseeing.  Good value for money considering central location."
"1888","Small rooms  Not enough wardrobe space  Noisy due to badly fitting windows  Badly designed breakfast rooms"
"1889","The rooms Worre very cold due to the very old vindues"
"1890","The staff were very kind and helpfull, eventhough there was a little mistake with a special request they tookcare of it instanly and gave us a nice compensation. The breakfast was amazing with a wide veraiety of food. Very quite a peacefull place."
"1891","The minigolf court was very poor and broken with no maintaince.  The price that was writen on the website was without the vat and wasnt nice to know at the check in that we need to add more money."
"1892","It's a good hotel, the proximity to the center it's a good value."
"1893","The price for parking is too expensive"
"1894","Very clean. Charming receptionist and very helpful."
"1895","Untidy and messy garden with litter and rubbish at the front outside so a bit daunting when you drive up to it but inside really neat and clean."
"1896","Lovely big room, well lit, splendid view. Reception very helpful, and food and waiting staff excellent.   Lots of parking available."
"1897","I can’t understand why are the dogs aloud in the hotel.  The cleanness and the noise is affected.  Sometimes I can’t simply rest    "
"1898","this comments just in view of the hotel being a 5 star hotel. hence it should be without coments.  slightly noisy, hearing conversation from other rooms.  elevators function randomly... i.e. no logic to when or which elevator will appear.  swimming pool sligthly to hot.... warm... not really to cool down.  if you order a cocktail at the swimming pool area the quality should be the same all the time, regardless who is making it.    "
"1899","I was quite happy with the service I got, the apartment was kept tidy including all necessary facilities, plus there were two swimming pools from which one was 70 m long, pretty impressive and handy for people interested into getting some training out there. The hotel staff was was kind and spoked English well."
"1900","On the down side I found it quite far from the main beach thus felt cut out or locked there. Night life there was down to zero, me doing many activities during the day and coming late back just in time to get a dinner prevented me from experiencing any entertainment which happened there. BTW from what I saw I learned that the entertainment targeted small children so as to give the numerous families deserved rest from the kids. Next things I was missing there were recycling facilities on the hotel and soups in the bathrooms. Apart of that it is a place where everyone can enjoy themselves if they chose this place for the right reason."
"1901","The location is great and breakfist is very testy"
"1902","Wow! we really could not fault the professionalism of the staff at our hotel. We had originally booked to stay at the Newcastle Centre Jury's Inn, however due to a problem with external providers (Hotelopia) the hotel was double booked. The staff assisted us by transferring us to the Quayside Jury's Inn, this turned out to be the better of the two and even threw in complimentary breakfast. We shall be returning very soon. Thank you for such a positive experience.    And oh my word...! The shower was amazing :D"
"1903","Ironing facilities could use some improvement."
"1904","The room was clean and tidy. The toilet did not flush properly, the shower curtain was coming apart? and the Tv did not work correctly (Server was down). Funny enough this is the same excuse the last time i stayed so the girl on reception telling me that someone will come and have a look at it was just lip service which was unnecessary, all she had to say was its not working. We had breakfast in the morning and it was very tasty however the person who thinks deep frying a potato scone and having them oozing fat when you cut into them is acceptable should be fired. Absolutely disgusting. What was more worrying was the foreign guests seeing this disgusting mess, scottish folk dont eat this muck. Theres no  hes a scotsman and its certainly not Nick Nairn. Tell the chef to stop being lazy and cook them properly. I have seen this in other hotels also.  Your costs for wifi are horrendous also, £15 for 24 hours. You guys need to get with the times. You want to attract a certain clientel you should be providing free wifi like any other hotel i have stayed in. The blue rinse brigade that I seen at your hotel would probably not be too bothered about not using wifi but other guests using smart phones, games consuls and laptops and ipads etc would be well miffed at your fees. Fortunately due to my tv not working i was given free access, so why not provide it free to start with? A connection fee of £2.50 per guest would more than  cover your anual fees for any maintainance. (A charge would still be unnecessary)  Your charges at the mini bar are also scandalous. Fair play you want to make an extra couple of quid on the goods in the room but £2.50 for a single caramel waifer, £5 for peanuts and jelly beans, come on, are your really that desperate to exploit your guests, seriously?. This is just desperate and really is a throw back to the bad old days of out of date hoteliers. Just because you are part of the Hilton chain doesnt mean jack these days, your competition is fierce and truthfully i have stayed in much better hotels for less and had free wifi, complimenary snacks etc. Sorry i forgot about the free complimentary hot cookie on arrival. Not sure what that was for but im sure someone at senior management thinks its cool and trendy? The last time we stayed at your hotel was when it was being renovated and it wasnt great then. We only came back due to you being the only hotel in the area we needed to be in with a pool, and even that looks like it could be doing with a freshen up. I think you are still dining out on the glory days of the old ""Dunblane Hydro"" but sadly your compettitors have surpassed what you offer. Remember this is only my opinion so good luck in the future but i doubt i will be back.   To sum up, if you want a hot cookie, big thumbs up, If you want to have your wallet looted for wifi and snaks in the room, give it a miss."

"1906","Very helpful, professional staff. Immaculately clean,modern Hotel. Free Wi-fi very useful."
"1907","Nowhere to sit outside."
"1908","These apartments are just on the edge of the village of Skala in a quiet residential area only 5 minute stroll to the main street and 10 minutes to the beach.  There is an off road parking area for the apartments which is really useful if you hire a car.  The apartments are serviced daily by the cleaning staff and the bed linen and towels changed twice weekly.  If you need any help the owner is on site in the evenings or you can contact her by phone and she comes immediately. You can pick a lemon from the trees in the parking area for your evening G"
"1909","Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable bed."
"1910","No lift to upper floor and no air conditioning(climate control) in room!"
"1911","Its is nice, lots of swimmingpools. The beds are not so good."
"1912","The apartment in Fuham was clean, spacious and good location if you were actually looking to be in the west London area, not so good when you book to stay in East London "
"1913","Terrible experience with Hotelopia, extremely disappointing weekend due to your errors.      We booked to stay at GoNativeStratford East on 29th June for one night. Upon arriving at the hotel at 2.30pm we were told that we were unable to check in until 3pm but we could leave our bags at reception. We explained that we had a busy schedule and were unlikely to be returning to the hotel until 10pm.      When arriving back at the hotel at 10pm we are asked to produce our booking confirmation which we did. We noticed that our bags were left in exactly the same place in the lobby area, when they invited us to leave our bags there we (stupidly) assumed that they would be kept in a locked room or at the very least behind the reception area. The hotel receptionist simply said there is no booking in your name, we have no rooms available and you will have to take it up with Hotelopia! We waited over an hour for the hotel to admit that they had a responsibility to find us a room somewhere. The solution was a room in Fulham, West London!! The taxi journey was over an hour.   Not once did the hotel offer an apology or show any sign of empathy with our predicament. We finally got to west London at 1.30am.      We drove to GoNativeStratford East and parked near by, because I had a couple of glasses of wine with my evening meal I was unable to drive that evening to the new offered apartment in Fulham. So we were now in West London, the complete opposite side of London to where are trip was centred around (Olympic Village) It took a taxi and two trains to get back to East London the next morning, all of which I had to pay for.     Complete shambles from start to finish, very stressful and expensive   "
"1914","Very good breakfast, although overbooked and crowded."
"1915","KEYSTONE KOPS vs FAWLTY TOWERS !!!!  1. Had to complain about semi comatose drunken guest's antics outside our room at 1.30 a.m. then desk staff kindly called us back at 2.00 a.m. to inform us all was well, the drunks were just having trouble with their room key!!!  2. Severe problems understanding and getting the staff to understand us due to their poor command of the English language.  3. Overpriced and quite shabby overall but I suppose we were paying for the seafront location.  "
"1916","The staff, especially the reception staff were wonderful. I became ill while at the hotel and needed to see a doctor.  The lovely lady at reception found me a wonderful doctor close by, there was a taxi waiting and within a couple of I was back enjoying my holiday."
"1917","The stairs are a  bit steep and I think I would have preferred the bed up stairs."
"1918","This hotel boasts excellent value for money and totally suitable for those holidaying to see the place, rather than to spent the time in their hotel and room. It is therefore very good for backpackers, couples and individuals and maybe groups, depending on the situation."
"1919","It is definitely not surgically clean but that does not mean it is dirty, just not spotless. Not so great for Families, since there are very few relaxation areas (e.g. no pool) where you can keep the kids in check. Warning: you need to climb the equivalent of 2-3 floors of steps to reach it."
"1920","They cleaned the rooms everyday."
"1921","I paid for brakefast but had to go to another hotel to eat. The rooms are old. My wife got biten by some insect and we had to rush her to hospital. "
"1922","Great hotel and staff"
"1923","Too noisy from the bar. Design flaw with the hotel that the open areas either side of the stairwells allows noise from the first floor bar to filter up to the bedrooms. Pity!"
"1924","Good quality for money very helpful staff "
"1925","We only stay in the hotel 1 night but could not fault the staff who were very pleasant and friendly and our room was spacious and clean.  Great location.  We have stayed at this hotel before and would not hesitate to stay again and recommend to friends."
"1926","Beautiful hotel on a wonderful island, 5-10 min drive from the citycentre.  Nice, clean room and bathroom. 2 enormous infinity pools overlooking the Nile, 1 relax pool.  Beautiful big well maintained garden with exotic plants and flours. Friendly staff, good food... Relax and enjoy!!!"
"1927","Location was very good, close to town "
"1928","Only one member of staff was not very pleasant but she was only there for one morning breakfast. She really needed some people skills."
"1929","We had a fantastic time.  Ignore the negative comments about the hotel, the hotel is old and charming, refurbishing it you could lose its charm.  The breakfast was fantastic and no problem asking fore gluten free."
"1930","room was small  Bathroom sink was in need of replacing (was all cracked and peeling)"
"1931","The guests I encountered were all pleasant. Some of the staff were friendly."
"1932","The window ledge next to the bed was dusty and dirty. The hand drier in the toilet was weak and kept going off. The light was left on in the dorm for much of the night."
"1933","room view and beach"
"1934","Good location and good quality facilities. Nice room"
"1935","We were very pleased with the level of cleanliness and the facilities at the hotel (Madeira theme night in the restaurant, billiard tables, table tennis, racketball court). Breakfast, both the food and service, was excellent.  Stunning views of the ocean.  Loved the large size of the rooms, and appreciated that the hotel staff honored our request for adjoining rooms."
"1936","Unfortunately, we have to report that on one of the days between June 25 and June 27, a cell phone, that was my father's work device, which was located in the inside pocket of his travel bag, was stolen from our room.  The only other valuables left in the room/that bag were passports, as we had carried all the currency with us.  We believe that the phone must have been taken during the short time we were at breakfast, because we would generally lock the bag in our suitcase when we leave for the day.  There was no other items of value left in the room.  We noticed the phone was missing only when we got to our final destination as the phone was switched off and not used for the entire duration of the trip.  While we do not expect that you will be able to locate the cellphone, we felt it prudent to report this incident to you so that you are aware of it and can take appropriate action, particularly if multiple complaints of this nature have been received in the same wing of the hotel.  "
"1937","Did not honor ""Breakfast included"" in our voucher but gave us coupon for the first day. HOTELOPIA should update their hotel descriptions."
"1938","There is nothing positive about this hotel very amateur and unprofessional staff"
"1939","We were told that we had no reservation and that they were fully booked. This is a scam as money was taken from visa. Be aware and don't book here as you will ruin your precious vacation time!!!!"
"1940","As above - really upset and dissapointed at the poor booking sertice we had and the poor apology which didnt even address the fact we had to try and find another hotel at such short notice which ruined our lovely day or the extra money we had to pay for this hotel ( we had no options)which was another 20 minutes away.  Would not recommend your service again due to the poor customer service in thinking another hotel was avaiable or the high price we had to pay. "
"1941","Good location and not bad food (especially the desserts)"
"1942","We booked this hotel, but we lived in Club Dena. Staff hotel Irmak moved us to Club Dena in first day without any conversation. After few days we understood that we were in love with Club Dena, stuff and people who lived there. Club Dena has a large swiming pool and spacious grounds. Irmak is very tight and people don't have enough space.     When it was only two days befor our leaving from Marmaris, girl from reception Irmak told us to move from Club Dena to Irmak. We explained what we don't want to move any there and just want her to leave us. After that all stuff from Irmak insisted that we have to move. We had very bad conversations that you don't want to have in your vacation. Finally we won, but now we can't recommed this hotel for anybody."
"1943","The staff was amazing.  From the valet to clerks.  Davon was the bellman and helped us so much and always with a smile. I loved the fact that it had a nice seating area as you walked into the hotel.  There was a nice with a bar towards the back of the reception area which catches your eye as soon as you walk in.  That tells me ""welcome, have a drink and relax"".  And we did, in the nice comfortable chairs., restaurant and coffee bar.  Very accommodating."
"1944","The air conditioning, or lack thereof, was terrible.  There was a little vent close to the ceiling and a small vent in bathroom.  It was not blowing out cool air at all.  It was as if it were on ""fan"".  It had two settings, low and high and no matter which button you pushed it stayed the same.  Unless, of course, you hit the ""off"" button."
"1945","I have filed a complaint as i didn't get to stay at the hotel booked, and the hotel i was moved to was dreadful."
"1946","Everything."
"1947","Firendly staff and polite at all times, clean room"
"1948","On arrival took some time to find my booking on the system , also i changed my mind about the breakfast and requested this at the reception but went down in the morning i found out that that this should have been paid for and given a voucher. and was told i was going to have to pay £10 for breakfast which i found expensive to say the least as my name wasnt down on the list. "
"1949","Great value for money and rooms cleaned every day."
"1950","Very clean and nice hotel..."
"1951","Thank you very much for  a lot of pleasure in Laguna Mitsis Resort and SPA .Unbelievable time for me and my friend in the end of June!Fine service  in the hotel."
"1952","Its a nice stay,only need metioned that hot water noly warm even cold"
"1953","The Enzo restaurant was nice, the meals were excellent."
"1954","The staff in this hotel were rude and obnoxious, the room was dirty with cigarette burns in the carpet and curtains. The window would not close so it was noisy all night (there's a mini motorway in front of the hotel), and the whole hotel is in need of refurbishment and renovation. For the price you pay here, you can get a much nicer place in Amman, and that's a guarantee. This Hotel, Le Meridien, Amman, is NOT recommended. Stay elsewhere."
"1955","Nice rooms, with a good view over central Amman, with good central heating and a great shower. The beds were comfortable, and the staff very helpful. And free WiFi.  The food was nice, but a bit pricey."
"1956","The pillows were very flat!  The buffet dinner is expensive for what you get."
"1957","The location is very good, only 2 minutes from the beach.  Everything are excellent!!!"
"1958","we booked 3 rooms in agroup booking when we arrived 2 rooms were close to eachother the 3rd room was on the floor below which wasn't acceptable for a group booking. We were also not advised when we booked or on the confirmation that £100 bond needs to be paid per room which resulted in £300 we needed to pay on arrival for our booking. The car park was also chargeable £10.00 for 24 hours and we had 2 cars, these should all be displayed clearly when making a booking!"
"1959","The hotel was just O.K. not my cup of tea. The price per room vs quality is a disconnect in other words I believe the price per room is to expensive for a two star hotel."
"1960","Spacious and clean everywhere.  Rooms are particularly comfortable with top quality linen.  Power shower is awesome!"
"1961","It looked nice in the pictures."
"1962","Very pleasant and helpfull staff. Rooms were very clean. There was nice, welcoming atmosphere in the hotel. Very nice view on the old town. Food was delicious - I´ve never eaten such tasty bacon :)"
"1963","Best hotel I have ever been on! The staff is great and the rooms are beautiful. If you ever need help, the staff will always help you."
"1964","Have a very large swimming pool and located to Sungai Petani town. Has a hyper market nearby and looking for food is not a problem."
"1965","Room are very old and soundproofing is very poor. Noise can come in from the front door and room next door."
"1966","Clean and nice hotel with a nice pool. The service was good and the staff was very friendly. Dinner was healthy and with a good variaty every day."
"1967","The waiters could not speak any english wich made it hard to communicate. Poor information about what ""halfboard"" really included. The wifi did not work at all in our room. "
"1968","Staff reacted positively and to my satisfaction to an issue I had to raise. "
"1969","Location is brilliant and staff is super friendly. Rooms are a bit dated but in perfectly acceptable condition (clean and well maintained). The choice of breakfast is quite limited but things that are available are excellent."
"1970","The only thing I found a little bit annoying was the airconditioning which was super loud and couldn't be switched off (at least I couldn't do it). It's not that hot in London ... switch it off!"
"1971","Had everything you need in room - air con, hair dryer, iron and board"
"1972","Cooked breakfast not that great as scrambled eggs were almost white and didnt taste of much and no mushrooms"
"1973","Friendly staff, central location and I would recommend to family and friends"
"1974","Nice and friendly staff, great room. Really just a nice quality hotel."
"1975","First room we was given had a smell of curry. We asked to be moved and we was given another room straight away. We had i repeat had to pay £5 to park over night. You don't usually expect to have to pay in a hotel car park."
"1976","Apartments are spacious and excellent value for money, with great views over Little Lake Bryan or the Downtown Disney area from the upper floors. Large swimming pool."
"1977","Breakfast, surrounding area"
"1978","The room was very nice and clean.   Nice view to the sea outside the window.   Bed was comfort.   Quality furniture.  "
"1979","Ancient CRT TV (with analog reception?)  Few parking spots!  Poor noise isolation, when the cleaning stuff was doing the rooms next door you could hear what they was talking about.  There is no concrete covering part of the path you cross when turning from the road to enter hotel's parking, so the car goes through unnecessary bumps and furthermore this caused a lot of dust in the air, especially in windy days."
"1980","Unfriendly front staff and a bit dirty room."
"1981","Once we were check-in, a staff sent us to the wrong room (212) but actually they set room 214 for us !!!  Then we had have to move from 212 to 214.  Once again, when we entered to room 214. We found that there had damped smell around the room and the floor was a bit dirty.  We asked to move, finally we moved to room 313. This room no had damped smell but again the floor was a bit dirty!!! "
"1982","Could improve breakfast for Vegetarians, which most people do for both health , religious etc. Have to keep up as food is big ticket in Malaysia. Why not think out of the box, if there is a cost issue, like offering a la carte or pre order"
"1983","Staff very Helpful and warm welcome"
"1984","Room service not listening as it should be, they made several errors (food sent to an incorrect room, not the right food asked for etc ...)"
"1985","We were denied access to the transit hotel as an onward boarding pass was not available to us until the morning. We were not made aware of the requirement to have such a document. I presumeded that access to the transit hotel  would be available after clearing customs and immigration. We were accommodated at the Protea Airport Hotel which is what I thought I had booked, at extra charge. Not happy."
"1986","Friendly staff and excellent facilities. Right near the town centre"
"1987","Disappointed at the cost of a single room. I can understand the cost being higher for single occupency for a double room but my room was a single room with a single bed so would have thought the cost would be half a double room."
"1988","Great location and ocean views.. will Definately be coming back next time we are in Oahu! Highly recommended!  "
"1989","Hotel was situated very nicely for sightseeing, although some taxi fares varied.    The Hotel staff were very nice, and did everything possible to make our stay as comfortable as possible.    Breakfast was lovely, so was afternoon Tea."
"1990","Rooms could have done with freshening up,  but very clean."
"1991","The hotel was so great, staff was very friendly. On  breakfast we had a different dishes and snacks. Next positive reviews is that the hotel was so nearly to beach. If somebody want spend cheap holiday I recommend this hotel. "
"1992","Awesome location! we used the MRT regularly. Staff work hard and are attentive. The rooms were beautiful, with finishing touches well thought out. Food at kitchen was amazing. Selection like you wouldn't believe."
"1993","Sound travelled! The rooms are clearly not insulated as we could hear the phone ringing next door......clearly! We also had neighbors who consistently came home in the early hours of the morning and had complete disregard to those trying to sleep. Noise just travelled up and down the corridor  to much considering what you pay per night. The lack of and the interrupted sleep definitely impacted on the quality of our stay there. I feel they need to have a strict noise policy in place and make all guests aware that noise is a problem. I think this policy should be regularly policed by staff making routine checks. Surely when a bunch of drunk men come in, they see this when they walk past reception?"
"1994","good location. nice pools. good sized apartments. 24 hour reception. friendly, helpful staff."
"1995","some apartments are reached by steps only.  not enough sun parasols for shade around pool area, especially as there were no sunbeds and parasols on beach."
"1996","So friendly , great location and so relaxing been 3 years now and will hopefully go again soon , lovely owner and staff x"
"1997","Could do with music near pool , Turkish of course "
"1998","Staff very friendly and helpfull"
"1999","No lift to upper floors"
"2000","Very nice staff, excellent breakfast and beautifull views."
"2001","Beautiful gardens, beautiful bedrooms, pleasant and helpful staff. Very good food, always presented with thick starched white linen and beautiful cutlery. Excellent gym. Lovely ambience. A hotel to suit all purposes."
"2002","  Breakfast is good but there is no variation on the breakfast buffet from day to day ( we stayed 12 nights).    "
"2003","Close proximity to beach - fantastic friendly staff - rooms very clean.  Would stay here again"
"2004","Rooms are basic - but when you are staying at beach location you don't require state of the art luxury - just cleanliness and good air con which La Niña has."
"2005","Staff, breakfast and local"
"2006","Old rooms and kitchen"
"2007","good servces and facility , clean room "
"2008","The reception staff were very friendly and helpful with information when asked"
"2009","No coffee and tea making facilities in our room."
"2010","Good clean facilities and pleasant, efficient and helpful staff. Good secure car parking. Can't comment on quality of food because we ate at other restaurants.  Good central location with easy access to visitor attractions."
"2011","  Dear All at the Hotel Mc aranciaHotel,  We would all like to say a BIG thank you to all for such an enjoyable stay at your hotel. All of you made us so welcome and were kind and helpful.  A special thank you to Animation LEVENT, who gave us some fantastic information about ALANYA places to go out of the city - that was fantastic.  We will certainly be recommending your hotel to our friends and hope that we can return some time.  Many thanks again  Salih ATIK    "
"2012","Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Hotel was very clean and in an excellent state of repair"
"2013","Breakfast was a bit of a free for all and the quality wasn't brilliant, but it was included in a very reasonable room rate so hard to be too critical"
"2014","The outstanding person in the line of duty is Ms Gitte Aterskov who made sure we were happy with our change of room and other inquiries. Whilst other front of house were either disinterested or just more concerned about their appearance then doing their job. The only positive is the central location of the hotel!"
"2015","The hotel does not rate a 4 star rating, the first room given had a skylight that cannot be covered right above the bed (room 333?) and we had to change to another room the next day.  Changed to room 425? which faced the Main Street and it was very noisy from early evening to late because of a dance club and youth hostel on either side of the hotel.  Anyone who is a light sleeper or need peace and quiet should avoid this place, even a 3 star rating will be kind on my part!"
"2016","1. the room key no function and have to came down twice only managed to check in. it was due to the staff key in wrong room number. funny.    2. Internet wiring problem and recommend to use wireless but very slow.    3. Check out ask to make payment again even being told alredy paid online.Lucky one senior staff came to solve the problem.    4. The key to scan out of function when wanted to left the parking gate. Lucky with the help of security only managed to went out from the hotel.     "
"2017","There was a complete and utter confusion about the time of our arrival at the hotel because we were forced to delay due to unexpected circumstances. In other words they didn't want to wait for us after 23:00 a.m. because there were no receptionist at that time!"
"2018","Best view,strategoc location to city centre and within walking distance.it is easy to find this hotel for a new comer."
"2019","Very nice place, but the hotel is very old and it needs renovation"
"2020","I have stayed in Prescott on 15 to 17 June and returned on 26 June 2013.  I am very impressed with the professionalism and hospitality of the hotel.  On the first two nights, I was upgraded to a suite although I booked through a third party website and was offered free breakfast.  Miss Melissa, the front desk manager was very helpful and pleasant.  I felt so welcome after a 19 hour flight.  Thank you Hotelopia for giving me the hotel comfirmation number and I have no problem checking in."
"2021","The location is outstanding.. very close to the beach and the center of Magaluf.. clean apartment with almost all the appliances needed."
"2022","One receptionist in the afternoon shift was super impolite with us but I take it as a individual act that does not represent the hotel."
"2023","Location of the hotel is very convenient. Bus stops right at the corner and is 2 stops to central Reykjavik, or walking its about 15 min. Breakfast was good (not spectacular but edible). We had a triple room that had a view of the mountains and water, very nice. Heavy duty curtains for nights when the sun doesn't actually set. Staff was friendly and helpful. There is a luggage storage available if you are checking in early or checking out before you actually need to leave. "
"2024","Paid internet. No ventilation in the bathroom so it gets a bit stuffy, and the windows only open so much. From what I noticed there is heating for the winter but we were there in summer and didn't need it. Didn't do the most spectacular job cleaning our room as all that was really done was a making of the bed. Otherwise, definitely worth the price we paid for it. "
"2025","Very clean,spacious apartment within an exellent neigborhood.Nice and calm,the owners stayed there,too."
"2026","all excellently"
"2027","no the Negative coments"
"2028","Food was very good. The size of our room(villa) was really ok. My SPA visit was very nice and they had ok prices. You could take your dinner and drinks to your room if you wanted. The area was Clean and nice. "
"2029","Beachtowels for rent was really bad and you could only change thoose on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. Russian visitors all over the Place. And they really dont know how to behave and stand in a line. Loud Music during dinner every night. Our visit at the Italian restaurant wasn´t what we expected. You couldn´t choose at all what you would like to eat. And no one told us what we could expect getting of food. Although the food was really tasty and good.  Life guard at the pool was sleeping several times so dont put your Children alone.  Staff was really bad in speaking English, we did manage but I Think that you can expact staff to speak and understand English."
"2030","Good service overall"
"2031","Newly built bad views around the building "
"2032","The food was great and also the staff serving us drinks ! House keeping (cleaning of room) good. Also very clean outside and inside all facilities (beach, poolarea restaurant etc). Friendly staff."
"2033","To many non English speaking people. Aircondition in the room did not work as good as we would expect but we never reported it since it was good enough."
"2034","This is a very stylish hotel which also has a lot of substance. The staff were extremely helpful and professional. Our room was comfortable and was pretty quiet, so we could sleep well. Breakfast was excellent, as one would expect in Germany, and the dinner we had on our last night was also of very good quality. I would recommend the hotel fully."
"2035","Great location within walking distance of clubs and Bora Bora beach."
"2036","Location was really good, easy accessibility to the beach and amenitites. The grounds of the hotel were really nice and peaceful and the pool was very good. Breakfast choice was also excellent."
"2037","Not good value for money, the rooms were overpriced for the size given.     In general, the staff were not very accomodating, helpful or friendly when dealing with extra requests. We have a 4 month old baby and had issues around the high chair at the restaurant and towels at the pool."
"2038","The 3 th beth was not a normal bed, but it was OK.  The airlink bus to the airport is very close to the hotel and also the bus to the centre. There are some restaurants and shops very nearby."
"2039","Not negative, but clients have to know walking to the centre is aprox. 10 - 15 minutes walk, but you can also take the bus to the centre.  It would be nice if you could also order eggs in the hotel for breakfast, this was not possible even if you wanted to pay for it."
"2040","Near to the beach"
"2041","Terrible breakfast. And it wasn't the lack of things, quite the opposite. But I couldn't eat a thing but the toasts. "
"2042","staff freindly and helpfull"
"2043","the bar near the pool was not open and you had to walk to the main bar to get any drinks in the daytime.  selection of food was really poor and so we did not use the all inclusive facilities that we paid for as the food was appalling "
"2044","never ever recommend no one to stay at this tortured place of hotel Guest  specificaly if young polite highly educated  girl ,, Recptionist ,tourtered Guests at one oclock after midnight  shouting  in face of tired young daughter I paid fully in advance  on line ,,,,hotel already got the confirmation ...,,her only sin got no printed voucher in hand Receptionist ,promising to call police,, disconnected  the lift and enforce young girl of 22 years to jump 3 floors after long driving trip of 8 hours ,,to enforce her to come back to reception to copy her ID ,,disconnect paid internet ,,checkin takes 35 minutes of pure disgusting face ,,,,,,sauvage sauvage and only Sauvage ,,,,please never ever advice any young girl to live at this hotel ,,,sadism  of treatment of Recepcionist is realy just painfulllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll and unhuman and Disgusting"
"2045","We ordered 1 double room, when we arrived we received 1 single room with 2 extra beds, when we absolutly not could accept this we got a little bigger ingle room with 4 regular beds, but this wasn't stil not a double room.  The hotel claimed that they didn't have double rooms?!?!?   Also it was  to clear that they had split people up in ""classes"" - how have paid most .. This is a bad signal to sent the gusts.   When this said we had a nice vacation, but next time we will make sure when we order 1 double room we will have a double room (2 rooms in one) .  Please comment on this !   Thanks Marianne - juulp@youmail.dk"
"2046","Good location with it being only a couple of minutes walk from East Croydon station "
"2047","Disappointed that there was no room safe considering it is a four star hotel. Also the tv channels  would benefit from having Sky Sports news as a minimum."
"2048","Very comfortable beds and pillows, on bus route for exploring East London, City and beyond"
"2049","Basic room but if all u want is a bed for the night and shower in the morning then it's perfect for that. Breakfast was very basic..... "
"2050","Reception staff were patient and accomodating. Piers in particular has an air of diplomacy."
"2051","That your buisness is not your own. I found this part ofTurkey to be an especially gossipy location. The hotel is far enough to escape the busy beach and club scene. But, near enough to get home safely after a good nite out."
"2052","You can smell the bleach this hotel is so clean,  great large pool area and lots of activities for the kids. Food fantastic and caters for all tastes."
"2053","Swimming pool is deep, there is a kids ankle splash pool, but main pool has no shallow end"
"2054","hotel is the best !!!!"
"2055","The hotel and staff were excellent. Towels and bed linen were changed regularly.  Located centrally in the resort. Had a lovely holiday. Would recommend."
"2056","Good service,nice room and location..."
"2057","Pool closed too early...."
"2058","Poor service - no hot water for 2 days in the middle of winter!!!! Management were not very interested in rectifying the problem.  We were asked to go shower in another room.  Walking down cold corridors in the middle of winter in our pajamas - certainly not my idea of friendly hospitality!    Parking in the building was terrible     I will never stay here again or recommend this hotel to anybody!  It makes a mockery of the great people it is named after."
"2059","Near of the beach  Near of Ocean Drive"
"2060","We really loved our visit in Amazones Village. It is beautiful, quite and lovely. A wonderful place, with a family atmosphere. We will come back and take  friends with us. Thanks!"
"2061","The bed is too hard."
"2062","lovely from start to finish"
"2063","Central to all touristsights and old city."
"2064","Staff friendly, great next to the beach, clean and well looked after.. Great holiday"
"2065","Very nice hotel, in a great central location"
"2066","Kind staff,  restaurant is excellent. The maid was very polite."
"2067","The desserts need some improvment, and anyway was not to our taste."
"2068","Perfectly situated in a quiet location but close to the West End and Euston station, so perfect for us."
"2069","Best place and very good rooms   then ramada 5 star hotel"
"2070","It was wonderful stay with my boyfriends, food was nice abs weather was nice even during raining season.   We enjoyed amazing pool which access from my room directly."
"2071","We felt some different service between Europian guests and Asian guests.  Also we requested private and privacy room, but next our rooms are Chinese family who have small kids between our room and they were talking so loud since morning.  The kids were running in front of our room and swimming always, also however there was no ash tray, we requested smoking room when we made booking."
"2072","A pleasantly appointed room in an ideal location. Wonderful, helpful and friendly employees from reception, to the cleaning staff and restaurant staff. There were many functions on whilst we stayed and everyone from business, tour groups, weddings and families we spoke were extremely happy with this hotel. Even though my parents are from Kalamata and we have plenty of family and friends to stay with, I would chose Pharae every time."
"2073","Well where do I start.... NO HOT WATER, girl at the reception evening/night very apologetic and good manored, girl in the morning...... No comment. After I let her know that there was not hot water in the morning as well the only thing she said was a plain ""yes"". When I asked for some compensation again a plain ""no"" was the answer.  I did not had time to ask for the manager as I had a boat to catch from Le Havre but it was a very disappointing experience. NEVER AGAIN in this hotel"
"2074","Amazing the staff the room the whole experience "
"2075","No salsa music or dancing in the hotel at night.Problems with the shower, air conditioning and tv."
"2076","Nice hotel. People at the reception were pleasant and professional. Nice pool and great location."
"2077","The room was nice but the shared bathroom was only accessible from one side ,which meant the third person had to enter the other bedroom tom access it.  The evening dinner menu was very limited.  The person at the door of the breakfast room made us wait outside even though there were free tables inside.This is very controlling and unwelcoming behavior. It is totally unnecessary.  Several times , my Cuban mother-in -law as questioned at the lift if she was a client of the hotel.This is RACISM and I do not accept. Either question everybody or nobody ,or if it's that much of a problem, make every guest wear a wristband.  We were also questioned one evening at dinner if that was included in our booking. I think this could easily have been clarified at reception without embarrassing us."
"2078","housekeeping service not good. called twice to get extra pillow, but waited 1 1/2 hour also never came"
"2079","Young lady on reception on our arrival was lovely and very helpful (no name tag so cannot indentify her). Brought ice to the room, explaned how to connect to the internet via Ipad etc etc.    Had a meal in the Bistro which was excellent quality and very good value for money. Staff very good and reasonably price wine list    The Tweed Room (used for breakfast and optionally for dinner) was very well appointed with lovely views.    Would definitely stay again but maybe for more than one night to fully appreciate the facilities, grounds and general location    Would definitley stay again but maybe for more than one night to fully appreciate the facilites, grounds and general location.    The hotel was warm, which is a major consideration for us.     "
"2080","Breakfast was not quite as good as the evening meal. I had the full cooked breakfast, fried eggs were undercooked which is a pet hate of mine. Haggis obviously had been in a warmer for some time as the outside was crusty (middle fine). Coffee was very good.     Choice of breakfast though very good. "
"2081","I found the staff in the dining room quite unfriendly in fact I did not observe them to acknowledge or speak to the many customers that spoke to them on the  in and out of restaurant.   The reception staff seemed more interested in cashing up rather than attending to clients."
"2082","The front desk was especially friendly and helpful with finding our  around Washington DC. They were always checking with us when we entered or left. How was our trip, could they do anything for us.  Hey did you know this is happending in the city. Etc."
"2083","The hotel is beautiful. The room was clean and comfortable."
"2084","Check in was to be at 3pm. The yankees were in town and the hotel was booked. There were 100's of guests in the lobby waiting for their rooms. We waited until 4:30 for our room to be available. This made it difficult to make dinner before the game."
"2085","Excellent choice... Love the location "
"2086","Wifi is only in public area. "
"2087","Please reorient you front desks staff especially with the policy of your hotel. "
"2088","Strategic location very close to Finance Centre metro station and one stop from Dubai mall. Decent breakfast."
"2089","Mostly patronized by Arab and middle Eastern clients. Hotel needs to be refurbished with a multicusine restaurant."
"2090","The reception by staff was exceptional"
"2091","Front staff willingly to help!"
"2092","No european power outlets in the room or hotel"
"2093","Beautiful site-everything seemed professional and effective-great breakfast and a very friendly staff,who would do anything for you.I would look forward to coming back"
"2094","Peerless Hotel with near perfect service and staff, couldn't fault it at all - wouldn't want to."
"2095","Excellent and very spacious rooms. Good breakfast. "
"2096","Not the best beach in Crete (always windy and causing waves). Too crowded on the beach and children screaming."
"2097","the hotel not talk us that the parking cost and we pay a lot , the hotel not in the centrom ,        "
"2098","Very relaxing well organised 5 star hotel, will deffinately be our first choice for Estoril / caiscais. Breakfast is amazing, very good selection of food. "
"2099","We booked standard triple room through Hotelopia but we got twin room with small camp bed. We were expecting a normal extra bed and hoping for a bigger room."
"2100","That there happened on calle de tablada de españa "
"2101","The receptionist was extremely kind and helpful"
"2102","The staff are really nice and friendly and do their best to be attentive and caring."
"2103","Location and service was excellent, highly recommend. Good value for money, 4 stops by metro to The Mall of Dubai and on a Airport line."
"2104","Excellent views. Great pool. Great location just 3mins from the beach. Most guided tours pick u up from front door."
"2105","This is a German hotel which isn't stated when booking. All the entertainment is German, the staff speak to u in German, if the menu has special options its usually German food.   The rooms are small for the price and the beds are sofa beds. I expected a lot more for the price.   More 3* in my opinion. "
"2106","I have been staying in the hotel a few times and I was really surprised this time with the improvement done since last my visit."
"2107","Very friendly staff made you feel very welcome at all times, anything you need they will try and accommodate to make your stay easy"

"2116","Outdoor pool closed even though not raining  Waitress in restaurant not very helpful, unsure of what she was doin"
"2117","Location was great"
"2118","Room size was sufficient but duvet was thin and TORN. Pillow was ripped at the zip and fastened together with a safety pin!   Was disappointing.    No one checked if we paid for breakfast. Those who didn't could just enter and eat for free. Food was always running out and choices was just sufficient. "
"2119","Enjoyed my stay. Breakfasts were very good and well presented with a good selection of foods.   Hotel reception excellent as was the friendliness of all staff particularly the staff servicing the rooms.  Excellent views from the terrace and pool area."
"2120","It is little bit far from the center, 15 min walk, but it can be done on foot well connected to airport by train 1 minute t station walking.  "
"2121","Places are clean and tidy.  Staff are polite and very helpful to the visitors.  Price is reasonable. "
"2122","Should inrease the varieties of food in the breakfast.  "
"2123","Nice place, good beach and sea. "
"2124","Food is not very good. Especially the deserts. Leftovers from a day before. "

"2127","Very comfortable, excellent food and friendly staff."
"2128","It is ok for what you pay, needs refurbishing particulately as its placed near Disney and the concierge was extremely helpful. Reception staff are a little slow at times but I understand it was busy at time we were there. "
"2129","Clean hotel with good central location "
"2130","Room service - The meal i asked for came incomplete, the person who brought it up acknowledged the error but never came back to rectify it, very disappointed with the service."
"2131","Its an OK hotel for the price."
"2132","I rested at the hotel with her two daughters 16 and 13 years old. we loved the hotel. My children and I are very happy. warm, intimate atmosphere in the hotel. big thanks to the guys from the animation Natalia, Enes, Tanya, Clements. the next year we will come only in this hotel :)."
"2133","Access from car park poor especially in the rain  Small double bed   Noise from traffic - main road outside and windows were old and not very sound proof"
"2134","Near to everything. beach ,nightlife, public transport, shoppingcentre, local bars.  it was a gayresort, but it was a very positive, nothing about "" see mee and  ? """
"2135","Hotel is very centrally located on the board walk and has direct access to the Pier."
"2136","Relatively unfriendly staff . Long lead time for room service and no variety for food options . We had booked an ocean view premium room by paying extra . But we were told that it is not available . Eventually we got one with a partial ocean view on a lower floor with dirty windows. The hotel corridor had torn off wall paper at several places that left a bad taste . Long ques for checkout . Overall a very dissapointing and unsatisfactory service . Not recommended at all!!"
"2137","Horrible plastic laminate is not welcoming and beds slide around on this surface"
"2138","Room very clean and peaceful.  Slept well"
"2139","Breakfast experince very poor  Had to wait for a table  Had to ask for tea cups "

"2143","it's a very nice resort for family gather and chillout. "
"2144","staff of the front desk seems not really willing to help but the rest of the staff and even the boss of the resort are very friendly and nice."
"2145","perfectly situated,really a heaven of confort,good food,kind service what do you need more ?"
"2146","Excellent hotel, great location."
"2147","The staff were lovely as they are all over Cuba, the hotel is situated in the back streets in the Old Town of Havana, and on arrival looks like something out of Beirut!! However when you go through the front door it is AMAZING, so historic and beautifully decorated, taking you really back in time. We felt completely safe at all times throughout our stay in Havana and a great place to mix with the local people in the local bars and restaurants... Fantastic stay, Thank you Hotel Raquel Boutique  "
"2148","Excellent hotel in Great location.  Lovely rooms with excellent service.  Staff at reception were the most helpful we have met.  Helped uswith getting  to beach. Places to eat. Help with further travel.  An outstanding hotel"
"2149","Just the first Hotel where I have been, everything was so perfect :). Especially cleanness    Even they clean my lap top out side just the top there was some fingerprints :). Really thoughtful from cleaner. Such a small thing can make customer happy ^_^.     So thanks again for everything!!    "
"2150","It was relatively cheaper compared to other hotels, but that was on the expenses of other negative things (please see negatives)."
"2151","It was stated on the website that it has (free Turkish bath and free wifii)-none of these are true. The Turkish bath is NOT free and when I asked them what its said on the website they said  (to go and lie to relax in the heated room is free, but to use water, message, peeling ...etc is chargable) and the price was much more than other places. We had 2 iphones and laptop-we could not connect to wiffi and the staff were not very helpful with this, they told us (the wiffi in the hotel is not compatible with UK IT system. I was not convinced about their explanation. I had to go and use other internet café in the town. The food, breakfast was realy bad,the only good thing was there was boiled egg. It was exactly the same every morning. Luch was made from whatever it was left from previous days. THe dinner was good and there was a variety of salads. When we booked, it stated that we had a good deal for British Citizens. We met some Russien people and we found out that whet they paid was significantly less than what we had paid. The other point was it was all russien and few polish. There were daily shows for children, they were disgusting and ridiculous-It was the worst holiday experience we have seen and I do not want any other British People to trap in this hotel, like we did."
"2152","Lovely hotel, in a quiet location on the water's edge.  Don't expect loads of nightlife as it doesn't happen around this hotel.  But then that is only a short taxi journey away.  Staff are very friendly.  Rooms are very clean.  I would definitely recommend it."
"2153","Food is expensive within the hotel.  But there are plenty of other places to eat not too far away."
"2154","Arrived at 2100 to be told the hotel was overbooked and had to drive 10 miles to find another hotel  Neither the hotel or booking site contacted me to offer an alternative  Would not use either in the future."
"2155","The Staff were friendly and helpful and in difficult circumstances tried to make the stay enjoyable."
"2156","The fact that the head waiter and manager left just after i arrived did not help and although the rooms were adequate my room was cleaned once in the week and my friends was not done at all which is not very good . The food for breakfast was fine but the half board option was extremely limited with little or no options so if you did not like curry you were stuck !"
"2157","Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean with plenty of room.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to philidelphia."
"2158","Dirty room.   Small bathroom.   No warm water, only during some parts of the day.  Low quality of breakfast.  Slippery floor.  Only 7 TV channels (CNN, RAI 3 plus Greek channels).  Noisy environment.  Towels with holes.  "
"2159","Very beautiful hotel. Nice facilities. Beautiful sea view."
"2160","Transportation is not convenient"
"2161","Very central and closed to Time Square!   "
"2162","High sound from A/C. Interior from the 80´s. No refrigerator in the room. "
"2163","relatively easy to find. very clean and tidy room, nice lounge, very comfy bed, good tea and coffee facilities, old fashioned but nice,"
"2164","noisy corridor where people slammed the doors a couple of times, and could hear people talking as they walked to their rooms, could also hear the TV in the next room. Parking is a bit of a problem, but once we had a parking space this was ok (it was unclear where we could park the car, no signs clear enough to show us where we could park. The chap was on reception, European chap not very chatty to the point with check-in"
"2165","Friendly and helpful reception staff  Good location"
"2166","freindly staff and very clean rooms "
"2167","The hotel is centrally located, easy to walk into the Old Town, plus on the promenade.    Majority of staff are very friendly, pool area is very good and plenty of sunbeds for all  Buffet breakfast very good, with an excellent selection.  Also dinner buffet was very good value for money  Very "
"2168","The first impression was not too good as the reception staff did not seem particularly friendly, helpful or welcoming at check in.   Fortunately this attitude was not universal and the majority of staff were helpful and pleasant  "
"2169","Very good location for the price in the busy season, quiet and friendly.    "
"2170","ideal location to get into London as well as Wembley too. Transport links are great."
"2171","Nice terrace, with view on the surroundings, where at dark with à lamp game is attracted."
"2172","Excellent gym, pool, front office staff helpful, doorman and luggage porters very helpful however housekeeping slow and not thorough only left one towel after housekeeping, did not replenish tea bags however on request to housekeeping problems were rectified promptly."
"2173","Service excellent  Help at hand by IT to fix problem with IPad   The Traders Club  Location very convenient  Being a Traders Club member is value for money"
"2174","Plenty of good beer! On the whole friendly staff. Food that is not of restaurant quality but is certainly not bad either – plenty of it and a nice variation. Nice big pool. Some of the rooms (3/4 bed) were of a good size. Good value for money.   "
"2175","Needs just a little TLC - small things could be done to vastly improve the hotel: fix things like the shower holder so the shower actually stays still! Sunbeds slightly uncomfortable and not enough parasols to go round. Pool area could do with the occasional rinse down with a hosepipe (to remove drink stains and bird droppings). More outside seating needed for the evening. Wifi range could be extended – if nothing else at least to the bar area. I am being picky - these are all minor points and did not affect our stay significantly. "
"2176","-  The bed was quite hard: a thin mattress on a wooden plank  -  There were only a few tea bags and coffee sachets, one sugar and no coffee milk, while we stayed two days with two persons.  -  It was quite difficult to get the key out of the door of the room."
"2177","Superb staff and classical feel about the hotel which  lives up to its name ""Grand"".  Superbly positioned for the main square and attractions."
"2178","The chef's omelette is not as we know it.   May be a bit noisy outside at times due to inconsiderate revellers."
"2179","The hotel is well located close to the station, supermarket and restaurants arround and just 15 minutes from the city centre."
"2180","Reception staff can improve the english language."
"2181","Location was excellent. Only 3 minutes walking to the metro station and 1 minute to the city tour bus stop. The hotel was good for what we wanted. Prices were excellent for two people because we paid in dollars to Hotelopia less than $700.00 US for 4 nights and a full breakfast. For two friends going 1/2 and 1/2 ($350.00 US each) it was a real bargain for England were everything is so expensive. (Not in pounds that was so expensive at the time of our trip). , Breakfast was good with fruit, meat, eggs, oatmeal, coffee, te, juices of all kind, and bread. The hotel has also an currency exchange booth, store for souvenirs and basic needs, concierge, bar, and best of all WiFi  FREE of charge as long as you use it at the lobby, which was fine with me. Room service was excellent, we asked for a blanket and in less than 5 minutes some body was there with the blanket.  Same happened with the old fashined TV control that was not working very well, as soon as I reported it, somebody came with a new control that worked very well. If all you want is to be in the center of everything and just go to the hotel to sleep, this is a perfect place for the money."
"2182","Hotel seems like a market a certain hours because there are young people coming and going all the time. Personnel is so overworked with so many demands of all these people that sometimes there were not very friendly at the front desk. At the restaurant, they were so many people too and they wanted you to carry your boucher all the time saying the type of breakfast you had paid for, English (full breakfast) or Continental (basic things only). If you wanted to change your mind and change from Continental to English, you had to pay $5.00 extra pounds per day. Twin beds did not have a good mattress but the sheets were changed daily, which made things better. Another thing that bothered me was that our room did not have an airconditioned unit at all. You just have to leave the windows open with the hope that the weather will be nice enough for you to get a nice night rest. The weather in June was OK, thanks God no rain at all, but at night it was a little uncomfortable as we went to bed, later on it got better as it got late."

"2187","Our stay at Corte dei Greci was great. We arrived very late due to a transportation ""issue"" but the desk was ready and very accommodating. The room was very large and beautiful. The hotel is on a small side canal but it is very easy to get to and convenient to Piazza San Marco. When we come back to Venice we will definitely stay at Corte dei Greci again. "
"2188","Lovely staff, great food. The room was perfect with a great view, the bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked perfectly. There was hot water all day and the staff who make up the rooms work around you which suited us perfectly."
"2189","Fantastic rooms,friendly staff and excellent facilities. We had a lovely time and it was a perfect location for us. Will definitely come back."
"2190","The only negative that I have is with regards to breakfast. We ordered seperate toast on one occasion and beans on another, and both were overlooked. It would be much easier if the order was written down! "
"2191","Good Parking facilities, out door Pool and seating area, beautiful village near by within 10-15 min with a local bar and lovely church,the hotel is also surrounded by local allotments and vineyards, it really is a pretty area to stay in. There is a retail park close by too, Friendly staff and the evening meal was lovely with the exception of the steak (too chewy) but the rest of the food was nice. Tea and coffee facilities in the room and TV, great air con, double bed was a bit small but very comfortable, Good generous buffet breakfast with good choices. Would definitely recommend"
"2192","Roadworks on entry of the hotel meant we had to do a diversion around the village, which was ok in the end as we realised it was an ideal area to have a lovely walk. Chinese tourists were a little noisy in the evening and early morning but not too bad. Situated on a main road but our room was at the back, so we were not bothered by noise."
"2193","Hotel is lovely, I was disappointed that when I arrived, there was a mix up with my booking, I thought I had  booked two king rooms and one double twin room, but the booking was only for one twin and one double, the receptionist didn't offer any compromise or solution "
"2194","Food is not good.. Not easy Enrace and exit to hotel as it is crowded with cars "
"2195","We enjoyed our stay on the beach, the coffeemaker in the gives the extra point, thanks ??"
"2196","Beautiful hotel in a great location, our large room had a lovely view of the canal."
"2197","The hotel is hard to find as Venice isn't great at signposting! Also the staff were friendly but more keen on trying to get us to take a water taxi at €70 than providing useful information on the vaporetto. The breakfast rooms are also not big enough to have all guests seated, and we had guests with plates of food standing in the middle of room waiting for us to vacate our table while we we still eating which wasn't great."
"2198","Great location. Very friendly and helpful staff."
"2199","We did require one double bed in our room for my wife and I but when we got our room (305) it only had 2 single beds pushed together. This was a little disappointing for my wife and I. Our children shared the other room (308)."
"2200","We upgraded to take advantage of the amazing views and the extra money was worth every penny. The room was clean and tidy, and the beds very comfortable."
"2201","I think the hotel is showing it's age and heritage in the public areas - carpets and wood are feeling very dated. Staff are efficient rather than friendly, and breakfast wasn't great - staff didn't bring my order and the food quality wasn't good enough for a hotel of this grade. Also there were conferences on the whole time we were there, and large groups meeting river cruises so the lobby was always busy and full of luggage."
"2202","Pleasant staff, willing to assist and supply helpful information.  Room clean and comfortable, plenty of choice for breakfast. Ideal location to explore the ""older"" part of Dubai."
"2203","perfect room for the price, u had everything! nice kitchen, beautifull balkoney, clean bathroom with even a tiny bath an the beach 10 meters from the appartments. "

"2206","Very good food selection at breakfast. Staff pleasant "
"2207","the roomwas big and spacious.The cleanliness was quite alright but not top class. The location of the hotel was perfect for tourists."
"2208","The breakfast was quite cold at times. The front desk staff was OK but not as friendly and at times temprimental at times when asked for help."
"2209","The choice of food was excellent but unfortunately it was never hot enough, most times it was Luke warm."
"2210","Clean and new rooms"
"2211","Free wifi, good location, clean, friendly staff, complimentary tea and coffee."

"2217","great staff , hotel lovely ,good food ,great facilities.The room was very clean and your domestic staff are a credit to the hotel"
"2218","the room was tired and needed a paint , new bed linen and some maintenance this would not stop us returning but  we heard every part of our neighbours conversation due to the very thin walls and that would prevent us from returning. we were unable to sleep due to the noise ,the room was very stuffy and the window did not open very wide .  "
"2219","Excellent location.  Smart staff and excellent service at front desk."
"2220","Very nice staff. Location was very good; not to far from the KTEL busstation and near the ancient ruins and archaeological museum."
"2221","The hotel did not have any swimming pools, in contrary to the provided information about the hotel."
"2222","The next morning, my husband told the reception staff they would have to move us as we could not tolerate the heat in the room.  They kindly moved us into a lovely suite for the second night of our stay."
"2223","Air conditioning did not work in our room despite attempts by staff to fix it.  They should have offered us another room as it was boiling hot.  The staff member gave us a couple of fans but these were not sufficient to cool the room."
"2224","The view is so beautyful,I never stay to the swimmingpool,but here so very nice,not all day music is screaming, the beach is also nice,sand and you can walk so easy in to it,allways sunbed everywhere,never have to wait for taking your food,the people who work there are all friendly,Whole hotel is very clean,I  like this hotel very much and we sure come back!!"
"2225","Only one thing ,the price for drinks is littlebit expensieve "
"2226","Everything was superclean, room, lobby and the breakfast room.  Friendly personal, specially at breakfast. Great location near Paddington and the tube.  I would certainly come again!"
"2227","Good location for busy nightlife area of benidorm."
"2228","I've stayed in 5 different hotels in Paris over the last 10 years and this was by far the best. It is a clean, modern hotel with unusually large rooms for a Paris hotel. The décor is stylish and modern, very comfortable beds and the bathrooms are exceptional. The hotel was quiet, had very good free Wi-Fi and 2 lifts made a difference when I was staying on the 5th floor. The position is perfect if you are arriving by Eurostar or wanting to catch a train anywhere, including the airport (CDG). The area is a bit rough round the edges but certainly not dangerous. "
"2229","The front desk staff were basically fine, but a bit gruff and not overly welcoming - but experience tells me that this is more of a Parisian trait than something specific to this hotel...have stayed in much more expensive hotels than this in Paris and never yet set a front desk employee smile!"
"2230","The hotel is in a great location, close by to restaurants, bars "
"2231","Sometimes a bit noisy early hours with doors slamming. Maybe walls are too thin between rooms. Not much else negative about this beautiful hotel!"
"2232","Very friendly staff, hotel room very clean and comfortable. Easy to check in and out. Impressed with quality of hotel."
"2233","Fire alarm warning woke us up at 3.58am to very loud ringing noise, definitely disturbed nights sleep. Then woken up again at 6.30am by noise from room above."
"2234","Very friendly and helpful staff. Good location and views. "
"2235","Bathroom could use a remodel"
"2236","Lovely room, set in lovely grounds. Great SPA used to relax in. Food was excellent in Restaurant."
"2237","Difficult to find. Signs were not clear. Although staff were excellent in the Restaurant, the service was slow."
"2238","Service and facilities were high standard"
"2239","Living area was small and the two small balconies were disappointing"
"2240","Convenient location to shopping centers and amusement parks!"
"2241","Very good size of rooms and very co-operative staff."
"2242","Breakfast can be improved."
"2243","It is a really good hotel, offering large and modern rooms. The staff is friendly and professional."
"2244","The neighborhood is not exactly the best, but it is not far from the city center and the main train station and not really dangerous."
"2245","Good location close to city centre"
"2246","Ugly building. Cost of car parking"
"2247","Children not allowed in pool.... Old man who owns the place wery negativ. Long  to the beach."
"2248","The Reception Lady was rude, onprofessional and didnt passed the hospitality services. Everything about her was not good, and cant speak english so good. This is a 4 star hotel, so you need to speak good english and have to be nice with your customers. Dont recommand this hotel ever and never will be go back. "
"2249","It was advertised as value of $690 for $398 this is False !  Poor attitude of staff and service, condensending attitude  The room did not meet expectation  2 star at best !"
"2250","We were impressed by every aspect of our experience, from easy access and car parking to the stylish room and the breakfast choices. We were grateful for the air conditioning and effective soundproofing in our room. "
"2251","The hotel surpassed our expectations and we were made to feel welcome throughout our stay"
"2252","very good staff, friendly and helpful"
"2253","So clean and the location is quite good."
"2254","hotel was very clean,near to shops and station and the staff helpfull"
"2255","problems with keycard"
"2256","Lovely rooms and a great location"
"2257","very convenient location within walking distance of many attractions, yet quiet enough not to be disturbed. Very pleasant terrace. The reception staff were very helpful and welcoming."
"2258","Good position"
"2259","Dirty floor in the room, very slow at responding to requests or not even getting back to me"
"2260","A lot of the staff have bad attitude and only a few speak English.  This hotel is great for Russian and Turk people, the rest should stay away."
"2261","were upgrade to no cost to deluxe room due to the full occupancy of standard room. very nice and big room"
"2262","Wonderful location and view. Our room was an amazing deal for the outstanding quality of furnishings and the amazing bed which was situated specifically to face the castle.  Wonderful experience - highly recommend."
"2263","I booked the hotel through the Momondo website. I searched for dates in late July, but somehow in the midst of my booking the dates changed in the system and I booked for the wrong dates by mistake. The booking was non-refundable and no one was willing to help me change the dates. Momondo said they had no responsibility, the hotel referred me to HotelOpia and HotelOpia referred me to the hotel. I lost my money and the opportunity to visit Copenhagen. I could never recommend a hotel with such bad and inhuman service."
"2264","Quality, service, friendly, clean and good food!"
"2265","Clean, friendly staff , close to the beach and busstop, good breakfast."
"2266","Lack of space to hang and store clothes."
"2267","staff courteous and helpful, room comfortable apart from comments below,"
"2268","Fantastic location, particularly if you need to be close to Victoria. We chose it for it's location with regard to the Apollo Victoria Theatre, this was perfect only a 10 minute walk away. The hotel was clean and well kept, and the staff were more than happy to help you. Despite being in the basement level, there were no issues with light or even noise from the road. Would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend and would visit again. "
"2269","The only downside to this stay was the bathroom could do with a bit of an update, but was very clean and well stocked. Also the dining area was slightly cramped and could do with the air conditioning being utilized; however it was not an issue that would deter me from staying again. "
"2270","Good location, convenient to airport, on beach and easy walk to local shops bars etc.   Lagoon swimming pool very large and fantastic for children, small pool at beach side of hotel little quieter ur also very nice. Both at a nice temperature!  Evening entertainment appeared to be enjoyed by all. Half board clients can choose between lunch or dinner which is very useful. "
"2271","Checkin / reception rather slow. There is a vast amount of food at meal times though it wasn't kept the warmest   The vast majority of guests are Spannish and everything very much geared towards them.    If the hotel wants to do something really useful, work out and publish the local bus timetable. The busses appear to be random and chaotic with often waits of 40 mins at the bus stop. "
"2272","small issues made the room seem in need of tlc. otherwise it's all good"
"2273","The most perfect hotel to stay at in Hawaii. The history, service, facilities and rooms are second to none.  I will most certainly be back!"
"2274","My only negative review would be having to pay for beach lounges! Working in hotels myself, I understand the cost of beach towel hire. However, I cannot justify having to pay $20-$25 for a sun lounge on on the beach when youre alreay paying top dollar to stay at a luxury hotel. That is ridiculous!"
"2275","We travelled Central Europe for 16 days, and A"
"2276","The hotel was very good. Very pleasant and helpful staff, including the chamber maids. Perfect position for the beach, nearby shops, and the local bus station."
"2277","My girlfriend left this hotel totally devastated about our stay. Soon after checking in we got rudely interrupted by a member of staff who simply walked into our room without permission from us. My girlfriend was in the shower at the time. This alone was terrible for her but to make matters worse this happend a second time whereby my girlfriend was naked in the room. This was a male member of staff who entered the second time and the reasons we were told at the time was to check a leak in the bathroom. This is totally no acceptable and we feel the need to tell you. We tried to seek a manger at the time but there was no manager on. "
"2278","Hotel is in a great position, with many great restaurants and bars in the area. The room was clean and the staff were very polite and helpful."
"2279","breakfast was very poor, I have stayed in many hotels including many budget hotels and it was the worst breakfast we have ever had, had to make your own tea by putting a tea bag into a cup of warm water - awful."
"2280","Great location and excellent restaurant "
"2281","SOME receptionists were less than friendly "
"2282","ok food,lots of drink,good sea and pool"
"2283","Very BIG - beacuse no free wifi ,i have to pay 25 euro for 1 week,very bad"
"2284","The view from the room was amazing, and you upgraded our room choice which was very kind. "
"2285","The air conditioning did not work, the room was 27degrees day and night and no opening windows which made our stay very unpleasant.  We booked half board, but the restaurant we had to use was closed when we arrived and did not open early enough for us to eat before we had to travel to the O2, and was closed when we returned. So we paid again for another meal in the pizzeria, which was bland and the drinks were overcharged, I have never seen such a small bottle of coke!  And at 2.75 for 100 ml!  The electric socket in the room sparked when you put in or took out a plug!  So my birthday weekend was not the best on account of not being able to sleep in 27 degrees. "
"2286","Surely the hotel doesn`t deserves 4 star as the quality of service is really unsatisfactorily!"
"2287","Bedrooms old and dated. Furniture /decor badly worn damaged and needs replacing.  Carpets heavily stained and dirty.  Not much of a beach at hotel."
"2288","Booked a double economy room and expected a double bed, however this was not the case. There was no window to outside so the room constantly smelled mouldy.   Dont understand the red light district look of the corridors."
"2289","The Holiday Inn was in a good location as far as access to the city eas concerned. The food on the lunch and dinner menus was great.  The Conceirge was knowledgable and very friendly as we're the majority of wait staff. "
"2290","Rooms were not vacuumed every day. Dirty glasses, plates and cutlery were not removed from the room, table not wiped.  The breakfast was mediocre and rather like being in a cafeteria, lukewarm coffee and no choice of breads for toast."

There's a supermarket across the street and other shops nearby, such as McDonald's. The breakfast is basic, but good. Wireless works well. Good value for money."
"2296","Don't expect a 5 star hotel, but it's pretty good. The only negative aspect was that the cleaning ladies talk too loud and start knocking at your door really early."
"2297","Decent breakfast"

After we had a walk to the beach we came back to find faeces (!!) in the middle of the hallway of the 1st floor!!  The pool didn't seem really clean, breakfast was not that exciting (but after all the dirt, we did not manage to eat anything). Wifi connection wad poor...

Their standard answer was to get a taxi, which wasn't necessary as trains were running with replacement buses and worked very well.  Think perhaps there was a deal going on with local taxi firm"

"2404","Recently stayed at the hotel and was somewhat disappointed for the room rate was expensive for what was provided. We found the pillows very hard and uncomfortable, there was a penny pinching attitude as allowing only two tea bags, very few coffees per day and only one water bottle on arrival – there were two people!! The TV was appalling with in effect no picture – why did you even bother? – was it a joke at the customer’s expense- literally? The bathroom was so small! And the soaps were difficult to operate. Regarding the breakfast the queues were appalling – as if being on some nasty cruise liner. If the price had not been so high I would have been less inclined to complain for the quality of breakfast was decent – but those apples were just shocking. The cleanliness also was appreciated and the feel of safety was good – but just the overall feeling left us as being ripped off, for the price paid and consequently we are asking you for compensation and some refund. Please appreciate our feelings and need for recompense. "

The only thing, she could offer me for lunch, was a sandwich with ham and cheese. In my opinion it's a rather poor choice for a four star hotel.   My room was lovely at first sight, but it was too small space at the desk, so it was almost impossible to sit there and work. It was very easy to hit your head when getting up from your bed or arm-chair because of really low sloping ceiling. "

The receptionist gave my fiancé a plastic bag within his car key in, but failed to explain that the exit ticket for the barrier was in it.  We ended up holding up quite a few cars as we did not know how to get out of the car park.  A stranger had to tell us - a job for the hotel receptionist."

I wish I asked for her name!)  The cleaning staff were also lovely, and always smiled - all staff did, which felt welcoming.  The breakfast was very nice, the male cook made excellent scrambled eggs! The options were good, only thing for me was that there were no hashbrowns (but I probably have enough of those!) otherwise always had a great selection. Aparently the croissants were a little frozen/stale some days and needed better warming up? Such a small thing though.  I loved the room service, I would say it's reasonably priced, I liked the Margarita Pizza and sometimes the chef would include a little plate of hot chips - yum! Adds a nice touch, like getting really good value.  The pool is the highlight, from the minute we saw it, it made it feel like a real holiday - it utilises the space well and has been tastefully decorated - I really think the architect has made a beautiful pool area.  The location is fairly central, about 5 minutes to the beach, a bit further to get to Jungceylon (15minutes). My boyfriend went to Maximum Gym during our stay which was about a 15-20minute walk along the beach.  "
"2812","Not much except the rack to wash your hands on the hand towel was positioned over the bath so you had to lean - hardly anything bad!    And would have liked hashbrowns at breakfast, but they did have a 'One Day Potatoe' hot dish with some herbs that were a nice alternative! Loved their guava juice..heard some reviews complain about the breakfast, but I'm pretty fussy about food and had no problems with selection!    Our only problem was that I forgot what day we checked out until that morning and wanted to extend the stay but would have had to pay full price for the room we were upgraded to (Pool View instead of City view) which was 2800baht per night! They weren't aware of the Hotelopia pay 4 nights, get 4 free offer and would only discount the room an extra 20% - which was nice of them, but not within our budget! So it's really great value if you get a good deal, but otherwise you gotta be rich! (sigh!)"

"2892","The first thing that struck us when we opened the door to our hotel room was the heat in the room. It turned out that the hotel had no air conditioning. In the closet we found a fan, but it did not help enough so we asked the hotel staff if we could get an additional fan, but we were told that all the rooms were booked and that it was not possible to get an additional one. This meant that we could not could stay in the hotel during the day because of the heat - we had to wait until it was evening.    The hotel rooms have a much lower standard than indicated by the pictures available on the internet. The TV was so small that we started laughing when we saw it. To view the TV picture from the bed, it was probably necessary to have a pair of binoculars. Once you have flushed the toilet, you need to wait 25 minutes before you can flush properly again.    One day we asked for an iron, but then we got the answer that they did not know where it was. Apparently they had just a single iron and they had already lent it to someone else.The hotel should have more than one.    Staff were not particularly helpful. They told excuses, but they did nothing practical to help us."

Daytime they played horrible old techno at top volume. Evenings even louder-kids music. Very strange.

"3083","We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in celebration of my partner's birthday - it's a lovely, luxurious hotel, tucked away in a really convenient location.  We had booked a junior suite but were upgraded to a full suite when we checked in without asking.  The suite had a separate bedroom, living room, huge bathroom and a fully equipped kitchen, plus lots of wardrobe space!  The suite was on the ground floor therefore no great views and a little dark but this didn't matter as we didn't spend too much time indoors.  The weather was glorious so we were able to make use of the courtyard bar which gave us a true feeling of being out somewhere on the continent rather than Central London!  We had breakfast included in our rate and this was served in the library - a small intimate experience rather than the usual buffet style you tend to get in most places these days.  A good selection of cereals, fruits, meats and cheeses were available to help yourself to and a basket of bread was delivered to the table and the hot breakfast was cooked to order.  We booked for a massage on the morning of our departure - this was a really enjoyable and relaxing experience.  All in all, a really pleasant stay with professional staff who had attention to detail to ensure guests were treated as individuals rather than a number.  I would gladly recommend this hotel and hope to return again some day."

One side of the hotel faces the water park and the other has a spectacular view of the pool, beach and ocean. Access to the property is closely monitored by the staff, only people staying at The Cove or The Reef can use the pools and beach.  This keeps the crowds down and ensures you can get a chair at the pool or on the beach.  If you can only put up with the crowds in the water park for a few hours a day, The Cove is a great place to remind you that you are in the Bahamas!"

"3167","For what you pay it's great value for money. The rooms are very clean, a bit on the small side but there's so much to see and do you only use the room for sleep. The centre is about a 15min walk, the Marina about 20mins and the beach about 25mins. Pleasant walks with lots to see. The Santa Barbara Castle isn't far either and is a must see, the views are brilliant! I went with my mum for a long weekend so this hotel was perfect. Half board, the food was great, large portions and the staff were extremely helpful. If you want to keep it cheap there's also a bus stop about 10min walk away that goes to and from the airport for €2.90 (single ticket). "

"3191","My husband and I have stayed in Per Avel in 2008 and a young woman was managing the place. The quality for the money was appropriate and the staff was friendly.   All in all we enjoyed our stay. For our holiday this year we had chosen the same hotel. When we arrived the current owner of the hotel was at reception. She told us she does not have our reservation. We explained her how we booked, for how many people, for how much and for how many nights. She was not willing to accept that we would have payed such an amount as the price would be wrong. Already frustrated as her behaviour was very unfriendly and even close to rude. My husband took out the confirmation from you guys. She looked at it and said she had never heard of it. My husband is Indian and surprisingly she would not even listen to him. The lady thought I am Russian and treated me much more polite. My husband asked if he could speak to the owner and she confirmed that would be her.   As we both work in 5* properties in central London (Jumeirah and Corinthia) we gave her enough time and options to check everything and were very polite, but there are limits. We had to ask her several times to call the number on the confirmation.   Even being on the phone she repeated: ""Oh, I have confirmed the reservation?""  During our stay the police came and took the owner for 2 days into arrest as she was underpaying her staff and not treating them right. That was very disturbing and we left a day earlier, not even thinking of a refund as we felt awful for the employees.  After we came home we checked trip advisor - unfortunately we were not surprised.   If your company believes in moral you should take Per Avel out of your list. It is not worth it the money. "

It took nearly an hour for them to change the key card for our room and the lady had to wait another hour for them to locate her room as her husband had already booked in in a group booking but they hadn't listened to her explaining this. I actually took this up with the manageress on duty as the staff were rather abrupt and off hand with us when we told them we had missed the racing that night due to the fiasco.. She was very efficient and kind and hopefully the staff will have some further training in listening to guests. Unfortunately that same night when we returned to our room we could not get in. We had to trail down to reception, wait until other guests were booked in and then the night receptionist told us that the key had been cancelled again!!

"3275","The hotel was outstanding. I was bitterly disappointed however, when I arrived they told me that there were no apartments available for my two daughters and I, they advised me that they had allocated two rooms to us. As my daughters are quite young, 14 and 10, I was not comfortable that we had to stay in two rooms, but we had no choice. The reason for this mix up is that they said they have never dealt with Hotelopia and that your booking system is not linked to their booking system. The confirmation that is sent through to them did not contain my contact information, so they could not warn me in advance. I would highly advise that you sort this out as the hotel is of superior quality and a true gem in Pretoria."

Unlike some of the stuffier resorts, Courtyard has a very laid-back feel to it. The pool and spa area were never too crowded and poolside staff were very helpful. We were lucky to get an upgrade from a garden view room to a pool/ocean view room which literally made our stay. Free Wifi was extremely useful as we were able to book tours and confirm flights using our iPad. Every night, the concierge desk would offer free Mai Tais to get guests started on Happy Hour. We made good use of the gym facilities which offset great meals enjoyed from the pool bar and restaurant. The hotel is within walking distance of a shopping mall and restaurants - very practical! All in all, we were very impressed with the Courtyard by Marriott and wouldn't hesitate recommending it to family and friends. Oh, and did we mention Zach at reception? A real Gem! As a famous Austrian once said, ""We'll be back!"""

The rest of the week they ensured that it wasn't just that time, they were really helpful and we had a great time staying at this hotel.   The rooms were clean and bright, good size and a very big balcony with seaview and view of the sunset.  The breakfast was good, perhaps not the biggest buffé but it was enough. They had good food in the restaurant as well and beautiful view of the ocean."

The location was maybe not the best if you don't want to walk to get to other restaurants but it wasn't that long, maybe 10 min walk to get to restaurants and smaller shops.   The beach that the hotel has is not very big and if there are many visitors you would not fit but if you walk along the water you find other places where you can swim."

We are non smokers and this wasn't the ideal start to the stay so that needed to be sorted (very inconvenient). The mattress needed to be replaced as you would roll into the middle of the bed (very annoying) neither my husband or I had a good nights sleep."

"3532","I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone.  The bed was horribly lumpy.  I did not dare look at the mattress for fear of what I might see.  The CRT TV did not work, I rang reception who apologised and sent a chap up to fix it.  Not wishing to discredit the man in anyway as he did nothing wrong, I felt uncomfortable being a female alone with an man, unknown to me, in my room.  He said 'when this happens we normally swap the TV for one in another room.  As the hotel is full tonight we can't do that. Sorry'  so I understand it was not unusual for the CRT TVs to not work.  He failed to fix the TV.  As I had paid £115 for the room for the night I was very disappointed that I could not watch the program I wanted to.  When I looked at the TV remote control it was so filthy I wondered which diseases I may catch from it.  The phone was also very dirty.  There was a row of tiles detached from the wall in the bathroom and some others loose.  The carpet by the bed was threadbare, the tv cabinet was filthy. The chairs in the room were very worn and faded.  Most of the bathroom was clean but the sign about re-use of towels was thick with dust.  I did not search out the cleanliness of every nook and cranny believing I would be horrified by what I might find. Had I not paid for the room in advance I would not have stayed there.  In the information it said that wifi was available free in all the public areas.  It turned out to only be available in reception.  there were 3 or 4 people trying to find where we could use wifi.    When, on the first night, I could not use the tv I spoke to the chap on reception explaining how disappointed I was when the night before I had paid half the money for a room in a hotel offering so much better facilities.  He said he would speak to the duty manager in the morning and perhaps I could have some money refunded.  When I spoke to another receptionist the next evening she knew nothing.  I gave up in despair.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  It may have been nice in about 1970 when I guess it was built and the furniture installed."

May as well have gone to a city centre and stayed in a homeless shelter. Please, if you like a little comfort and relaxing holiday do not go here"

"3694","Waited 90 minutes for checking in, just to be told, that our room was not available and that we had been 'upgraded' to another hotel. Reason was, that a russian airline was bankrupt, and that the russians on the hotel therefore couldn't check out and go home.    We were sent to another hotel, where we had to start all over in the checkin process. It took appx. 90 minutes extra to get the room on Magic Life Water World Imperial in Belek.    Only after 48  hours we were able to get the room we had booked at Pegasus World. Makind day 3 a travel day too.    Our daughter had the worst birthday (8 years) ever at the hotel. We arranged a la carte restaurant on the day, and ordered special birthday ice cream for her (and her younger brother) - 5 Euro each ice cream. First of all the birthday ice cream was exactly the same, as the ice cream that was all included to me and my wife. Second it was just placed on the table in front of her. 5 minutes later the waiters turned of the light, and brougt in a cake with fireworks into the very small restaurant while singing a birthday song - for another kid. The whole restaurant applauded afterwards.    My daughter asked us sadly why they didn't sing for her. These things matters a lot when youre only 7-8 years old.    Things went even worse, when yet another kid was celebrated on stage to the kids entertainment show after the dinner (we hadn't thought of that possibility).    All in all it was a terrible evening and my daughter also commented it as 'the worst birthday ever - when are we going home?'.    I'm not very impressed by neither the reception staff nor the restaurant staff.  "

"3750","I was sent an invitation to have a complimentary cocktail at the bar, however i did not take the invite with me (as it did not say i needed to present it to redeem the complimentary drink). Upon checkout the hotel charged me for the drink, and when i explained i didn't realise i had to take the invite with me, the hotel staff member then advised that i would still be charged unless i provided her with the original invite, as it had a unique code. Thought this was a bit silly when they could have noted it on my room notes that i was given this, rather than me having to ""prove"" this. Small hiccup in an otherwise lovely stay."

"3753","The Tivoli Marina Hotel is excellently located to the Marina and the gorgeous beach.  This enables you to enjoy long walks along the beach during the day and relaxing on a sun lounger to enjoy a good book, while enjoying the peaceful sound of the waves.  At night the Marina comes to life and is nicely lit up.  The hotel enables the ladies to wear their high heels as everything is on your doorstep.  The Marina spoils you for choice of places to eat as there is no shortage of really good restaurants.  The swimming pool at the hotel is excellent and you can enjoy a relaxing day sunbathing.  The room service staff are very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are kept very clean on a daily basis.  Towels are replaced regularly (twice daily).  The breakfast buffet is extremely good, we really enjoyed a freshly cooked omelette every morning, fresh fruit and cereal.  "
"3754","The decor was a little dated and could do with some updating.  The balcony in rooms obstruct your view, which is a little disappointing.  The price of alcoholic drinks by the pool were very expensive, too pricey.  Drinks in the bar were also too expensive.  Would have liked more entertainment in the sidebar.  Music finished at midnight.  The hotel use to have a saxophone player or a pianist which was very enjoyable.  We feel the side bar has lost its original lively atmosphere of years gone by.  "

I was expecting a wooden crib with locking wheels or something. Maybe the staff can be informed to describe the provided ""cribs"" as play pen's. Not a huge issue, just one thing I wasn't overly thrilled about. I'm assuming most hotels use these for their baby guests.    We also had an issue w/ our bed the first night. I guess they had just changed their mattresses and our was apparently missed as it felt like we were sleeping on an air mattress that wasn't blown up all the . My husband and I kept on rolling in to the centre. I wasn't about to go complain in the middle of the night to change rooms as my baby had JUST fallen asleep after an hour of screaming her head off. In the morning, I informed the front desk of this issue, and they quickly got us a new room, a much better (larger and nicer) room, plus they gave us complimentary breakfast and free parking for this inconvenience. So, they definitely fixed our problem accordingly."

"4245","I like a few days in Valencia after the FIB festival in Benicassim and is an easy 75km travel by bus or train. I found this hotel 3 years ago and have used it for a 2/3 night stay each year since with friends and my children. Its location for a traveler is faultless, 300m from Colon metro station which in turn is a 20 min metro ride straight into Valencia airport.Value for money it most certainly is, a great base from where to explore the city, located in the old city just round the corner from the main historic sights. Friendly and helpful hotel staff, and clean rooms with adequate facilities. Having found this hotel for the money I do not intend to use any others when visiting valencia.      "

"4251","Possibly the worst hotel ever. Booked a double room and got put in a twin. Despite repeated complaints to staff they refused to do anything and were incredibly rude. The shower had bursts of incredibly hot water which caused a scalding injury to my girlfriend. Anyone incapable of jumping out of a bath would suffer severe burns. Operating the tv required a launch sequence more complex than the space shuttle and even the person sent to fix it struggled to work it out. There was no complimentary water and a small bottle from the minibar cost 7 soles. We attempted to book a taxi to the airport and they said the charge would be 25usd, compared to just 15 soles we had been charged at another hotel. When we asked the concierge whether she would pay that much for a taxi to the airport she laughed. Do not stay here."

There were frequently occasions where a lot of people wanted to dine or sit and have a drink and the staff was not able to cope. This hotel clearly attracts a lot of visitors for its convenience but this should not be a reason for neglecting the fundamentals of customer service i.e adequate numbers of staff on reception, the ability to order a drink on a very hot night after 11pm or food for that matter. I witnessed a family group of 8 Swedish tourist wishing to have dinner. Upon the father turning away to talk to his wife, two staff members commented on the clothing he was wearing. Not nice or necessary given that the customers are paying and perfectly polite. ( not to mention it is totally unprofessional) I feel that some management could really address some of these issues because the basis is there with very friendly staff already. "

"4376","The service at this hotel is unfortunatley not that of a 5 star hotel. At breakfast they do not replenish food very often and we had to ask for plates, then bowls, then milk at the buffet breakfast. When we arrived we asked at reception for an ice bucket for our champagne we had bought with us - it didnt arrive and we rang to chase it up 45 mins later. The staff at the pool were very slow to do what I presume they are paid for which is getting your towels and drinks when required. If they had been more attentive then we would probably have spent more money on snacks and drinks however youneeded to find one and try and catch their eye or go up to the bar area. The first night we didnt get their till about 10pm and they told us that the pool bar was doing food till 11pm, they didnt look pleased to see us though when we turned up at 10.30 and we were just left standing their while they chatted and grumbled to themselves then gave us a table. They then got our drinks order wrong (left the rum out of the rum and coke) and forgot then to bring the next lot of drinks and we had to go and find the waiter and ask him if he was going to bring them - he had forgot. The hotel is quite a nice building but does not have 6 restuarants as it is marketed as having. One restuarant we knew was going to be closed but even with that one I still cant make it anymore than 4 places to eat?  We always try and go to a 5 star/luxury short break once a year and unfortunatley the staff here let this resort down and make it feel more like a 3 star. I would suggest that the manager visits the Four seasons in cyprus and experiences the 5 star treatment and service there and keeps a closer eye on what his staff are doing/not doing. "

One restuarant we knew was going to be closed but even with that one I still cant make it anymore than 4 places to eat?  We always try and go to a 5 star/luxury short break once a year and unfortunatley the staff here let this resort down and make it feel more like a 3 star. I would suggest that the manager visits the Four seasons in cyprus and experiences the 5 star treatment and service there and keeps a closer eye on what his staff are doing/not doing. "

In one of the rooms, air condition was stuck and it was freezing the whole time. In the other room air condition was not working at all and it was  30 degrees the whole time.

So £190-200 for B B, or £150 for DB B? Regardless I booked the room through a different website and got the room for £100. Even after speaking to them directly and asking what the prices were, 5 mins later I got the room almost half price online. All I can say is that from now on I will not deal with them direct, but go through an agent. Shame really ;("

Big welcoming smiles which made me feel happy straight away. They had seen the wedding room set up and were raving about it and we did check it out and it was fabulous! Our room 229 was large and had good quality mattress on the bed. A tiny tad dated but everywhere was immaculately clean so couldn't have asked for anything more. All the staff at the hotel appeared happy and all courteous. I also thoroughly enjoyed the vast selection of food for breakfast. You certainly would not go hungry here.

My sons favourite was freshly prepared pancakes with maple syrup and hot chocolate to drink but full cooked breakfast, fresh fruit, cold meats and cheese, various fresh breads and rolls, cereals  and pastries were all available. The hotel was located five minutes walk from main station which took you to centre of Vienna in ten minutes. There was also Prater park which was a seven minute train ride or a 25 minute walk from the hotel. This was a free to enter fun park with rides, places to eat and attractions like Madam Tusons all at reasonable prices."

So what if you booked a room 2 weeks ago.You'll need to find a parking space yourself (even if you are differently able, like me). It took me 45 minutes to walk back to the hotel from the parking space I found, as I'm on crutches and walking is difficult.  Graffiti in a hotel? Not even the good artsy kind either.  Because the clientele is not vetted, Don't expect a good nights sleep either.  I didn't actually sleep in my room as I couldn't face the noize.

Quite often these were not replaced when they were empty for sometime  7) The opening times for the restaurant did not hold as the food in the main restaurant was removed approx 1/2 hour before closing time (especially for the evening meal). Also, if things ran out, e.g. percolated coffee, it was not refilled if it was within an hour of closing time.

We were not given the code to access the Wi-fi and had to go back to reception to ask for it. We ordered a wake up call but insted they knocked on our room door as apparently the phone wasnt working though it looked totally normal and this obviously wasnt our fault.  We mentioned we were getting the ferry in the morning and no directions to the ferry terminal were offered - this was not expected but would have been a nice bonus.  Breakfast (full english) was £15 with an additional £5 to have it in your room! Crazy price for a relatively budget hotel so totally put us off at that price.  We got the same thing on the ferry for £5 (small) or £8 (big, including tea or coffee)."

Breakfast (full english) was £15 with an additional £5 to have it in your room! Crazy price for a relatively budget hotel so totally put us off at that price.  We got the same thing on the ferry for £5 (small) or £8 (big, including tea or coffee)."

I have visited Tenerife 14 times and I have to say that this was the first time I have had such a negative experience. The queue at the bar was terrible and only being aloud 2 drinks at a time was unacceptable. You cannot class showing birds with the intent to get photo as entertainment and the food was of such poor quality that we had to eat out on numerous occasions. Our 18 year old sons did not eat in the hotel at all as the food was so bad.   The hotel itself was really nice and it could easily be turned around. Additional staff on bar and possibly a drinks machine where people could help themselves to soft drinks (safe staff time), real entertainment with singers and dancers including a proper childrens disco with lights etc. For the food have some themed nights and in addition work out a better system for queuing.  Until these issues are resolved I would not recommend staying within this resort as it is not good value and you end up returning home disappointed. "

Far enough away from Galway to be quiet and yet near enough to walk in to town if required (it took 30 minutes) or get a taxi (12 Euro).

Really good cleaning in the room and throughout the hotel with lots of cheery and friendly staff. Hard to fault and for £125 a room (not including breakfast which was 10 Euro 50) during the Galway festival it was tremendous.

Fancy a coffee, if your lucky there might be a cup.  There is an abundance of fresh fruit available in Thailand and its cheap and beautiful, not here tho, when its put out its away within seconds because not enough is being put out, I had 7 breakfasts and managed to secure fruit twice, it was only watermelon at that, no dragon fruit or mango here.

"5515","Funky, modern and stylish. Compact rooms (known as cabins) very cleverly thought out and designed by those skilful people who create the seats in the pointed end of aeroplanes... and it shows, with their clever use of space and the attention to detail that so many hotels don't have; such as a tray in the room so you can carry your complimentary drinks and muffin back upstairs; a strap to hold the lid of your suitcase open when it's on the stand, built-in alarm clock, storage space under the bed and mood lighting which activates when you enter the room. No super-frills like a shower cap and small bottles of useless toiletries, but the large, refillable bottles were great as they show an environmental awareness. No brewing-up in the room either, but each floor has a 'galley' with cold drink vending and as much free hot tea, coffee and chocolate that you can manage to consume. The beds in the smaller rooms fold upwards to make a daybed-style sofa which is pretty neat. I have to mention the luggage storage area in the main lobby: a fantastic robot which whisks your bag away into a safe and secure wall with much more style than a concierge could ever manage! All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this hotel for all the points already mentioned, plus the fact that its location is perfect for everything that NYC has to offer."

"5588","Breakfast was organised but there were frenetic amounts of activity from the waiting staff that made it difficult to relax and eat calmly.Waiters were running up and down the aisles collecting plates, and with hot pots of liquid too. Waiters were walking so fast to replenish food stocks that I witnessed 3 guests getting bumped into by accident but quite forcibly. and frequent spillages of juice from the waiters around the cereal section. My father is disabled and he was told the breakfast room could not accomodate his mobility scooter so he would have to transfer to a chair at breakfast. My father is paralysed in his lower body and could not possibly do this. He was offended to be told at breakfast time that he could not be accomodated and it was apparent that the breakfast greeter was not aware of disablility issues. The breakfast room needs to be less tightly packed with tables/chairs and more provision pf space made for guests who are disabled and in a wheelchair or mobility scooter.  Also at breakfast I asked for vegetarian sausages which I had to wait 20 minutes for - my father had to wait the same length of time for porridge too. Would it not be better to have an urn of porridge for self service and to have a small amount of vegetarian sausages on the hot plate that are replenished when low."
"5589","Lovely character to rooms, great sea view and excellent value. Excellent location. Leisure club and parking facilities a welcome bonus."
"5590","Breakfast was organised but there were frenetic amounts of activity from the waiting staff that made it difficult to relax and eat calmly.Waiters were running up and down the aisles collecting plates, and with hot pots of liquid too. Waiters were walking so fast to replenish food stocks that I witnessed 3 guests getting bumped into by accident but quite forcibly. and frequent spillages of juice from the waiters around the cereal section. My father is disabled and he was told the breakfast room could not accomodate his mobility scooter so he would have to transfer to a chair at breakfast. My father is paralysed in his lower body and could not possibly do this. He was offended to be told at breakfast time that he could not be accomodated and it was apparent that the breakfast greeter was not aware of disablility issues. The breakfast room needs to be less tightly packed with tables/chairs and more provision pf space made for guests who are disabled and in a wheelchair or mobility scooter.

I assume since the water trickle increased and decreased that it was coming from a room above(perhaps the shower in that room). I could not have stayed in that room for 5 days. I was moved to another room however which was fine and I was very happy with it"

When people yelled, he just closed them while still driving.  He didn't know were Monaco was and asked a man in a bar and then droped us off in the middle of the street so we had to ask  in some stores.  When we finely found the Apartments Monaco there was no reception, but a sign told us to go to Hotel Goya. We were told it was overbooked and had to change to another Hotel 10 km. from there for 2 days. We stayed there for 1 day and then got our apartment. The closed smelled so bad that we could't use them. The bed in the livingroom wasn't made so we had to ask the cleaning people for an extra pillow and pillow case. The bed in the living room was broken, so we had to put the mattress on the floor. We showed it to cleaning people and hope it is fixed for the next family.  Nice holiday for 12 days. A lot of noise in the night. Will we go again ? Yes we would, because now we know what we are coming to."

Sent an email to hotel direct about a minor room request and was told hoteltopia had been sent an email to say the room was not available. Hoteltopia did not contact me then, nor since. They cannot be contacted by email, which is pretty hopeless when you are already travelling. The hotel after a day or two emailed back and said they could now fit me in and were very pleasant in their correspondence, but by that time it was too late I had to book elsewhere. I get the impression from hoteltopia reviews that others have had this phantom booking problem too.... Look up the poor reviews.   I don't know about this hotel apart from our emails, but they seemed to try to help. Hoteltopia have not communicated with me yet, other than this odd request in an email to judge a hotel that they failed to book me into.  I have some major reservations about Hoteltopia and its non existent customer service and would suggest you think carefully about booking this hotel through them, especially if they are showing room availability that other web sites are not showing."

Removing the key card from the card slot disables all electric facilities of the room, including the fridge. They should make the necessary arrangement so the fridge can stay on all the time.     During our stay we realized that one of the two toasters at the breakfast buffet was broken. None fixed it, and every day was put out to the buffet broken.     The toast bread was also stale....we never manage to make a toast.    Also you advertise the hotel as a 4 star but the hotel documents shows that is a 3 star hotel!"

Great pool with a view. The services and the room were 3-star, as promised. Nothing to complain about regarding the accomodation. Clean and neat. Highly recommended."

"5915","Molos Bay Hotel Kissamos - Crete: The hotel is a real 4 stars and even better. All was above expectations. Rooms are big, clean comfortable, quiet. The beach is in front of the hotel. The water is clean. For the first meters is shallow and is safe for children. The facilities at the beach (umbrella, beds and towel) are included in the room price like many other services like the safe, satellite TV and wifi. The swimming pool is also very nice. All  you need is available to make your vacation excellent for the best relax and comfort without unexpected hidden costs. The food is also excellent with a large and quality choice both for cold and warm dishes and dessert. Most of the food is typical of Crete/Greece, but you find also more continental/international type of dishes. Large is the choice also for  breakfast. The yogurt is really unforgettable. All product are really fresh and cooked by experienced cooks. The hospitality is above any other hotel/resort I have visited in more than 30 years. The personnel is always available to make your vacation the best. The Hotel Manager is indeed doing an excellent work. Special evenings are organized like the Cretan evening that was a very nice opportunity to taste Cretan food and experience typical music and dances. The hotel is also very nice located to 5 min walking distance to the center Kissamos village with its shops and restaurants. It is also favorably located to reach in 20 min by car the beautiful Falasarna beach and  within an hour the Balos beach (one of the most beautiful pristine in all Greece). Elafonisi beach (also one of the most beautiful) is a perfect destination for a day trip. Highly recommended to everybody for a perfect vacation or also for team building."

"6066","There are no hangers in the rooms so you don´t have anywhere to hang your wet bathing suits or your beach towel. Also the rooms lack litter bins accept from one tiny in the bathroom. In the shower you have no where to put the shampoo except for on the floor. The shampoo and soap you recieve on the rooms does not include conditioner so you must bring your own if you have long hair.   Also entry to the spa is not included but you get a discount and then it costs around 17 EUR but it should be included for that price you pay for the hotel. "

Pillows are supplied but you are not able to ask for more without feeling very small by patronising staff 'who don't have access' to that area. Breakfast well, be there early or it's a total bun fight including the non English speaking uncooperative staff. Overall I am very disappointed and there was no attempted to rectify these issues upon complaint the morning after. Please avoid. "

"6081","At arrival at the hotel, they couldn't find our reservation. Was told hotelopia hasn't sent the reservation through to them.  So I had no room. 4 hours later I got a call that they made a mistake and it was under my first name and not surname..  Lucky I had to go to a meeting for few hours but that's not the point. As I was so stressed out.  So then they gave me a room. But had upgraded me to a suite, and extended my stay for few hours and sorting my parking out.  Overall this hotel is very impressive, Raphael the manager and his team were brilliant and made sure I was compensated and looked after.     Hotel is abit far from Stratford cost £15 my taxi. But 25 mins by DLR which is very close.    The sauna, pool and steam room was amazing.    Breakfast is abit let down as its grab n go style.     But u can have full English breakfast in the fede restaurant for £12 per head!!     They are professional and made our stay very pleasant.  Will defo go back.  "

"6085","Booked a twin queen bed room.  Plenty of space for me and my friend and the additonal features in the room such as the fridge, microwave, ipod/ iphone dock and filter coffee machine were great.  Bathroom was decent sized for NYC with good pressure on the shower and complimentary toiletries.  Dreamspa beds were just what we needed after over 7 hours travelling, very comfortable! Room was spotless. Complimentary breakfast available is just right to set you up for the day - bagles, toast, yoghurt, fruit, oatmeal, muffins, doughnuts, cereal, boiled eggs, tea/ coffee etc. no frills and plastic cutlery but that didn't bother us. There is a restaurant at the hotel which we didn't get a chance to try but always seemed fairly busy. Didn't get a chance to try the fitness facilities but free wi-fi was a boost.  Staff were helpful, arranged a cab for us to the airport and stored our luggage for the day when we checked out which saved us trailling it around the city.  Closest subway is just a couple blocks up from the hotel entrance. Would definitely stay here if I was in NYC again."
"6086","In my opinion there were no negatives, perhaps if you were looking to stay very centrally although as I say subway is close and it's only about 10-15 mins to get into the touristy areas.  Again, perhaps if you were looking for a luxury break but perfect if you are just looking for a room for the night whilst exploring NYC. "

The service is far, far from the 5 star hotels I stayed in the past.     Secondly, to have a 5 star hotel and not provide adequate wireless Internet is a big NO. In the era where everybody is connected at all time this was far below my expectations. Not having even wireless in the rooms was also really bad. If you come to this place to also try to do some work in the afternoon it's was impossible. The existing wireless Internet is really poor.     Personally, I'm not a fan of buffets so the ""food for everyone"" is not for me. Visit the other restaurants of the hotel where they can serve you food made for you or the Greek tavernas in Paralia instead like Bambi's "

"6530","Something they don't tell you is that internet access is ONLY available in the lobby which was the biggest bummer for me. The internet access itself is good though and you don't have to deal with a captive portal cutting you off every 5 seconds or 50% packet loss or shitty bandwidth. The A/C was too loud and only had ON and OFF so either you had to wear a sweatshirt to bed and ear plugs or a speedo and sweat it out. (this was August) The location is not that convenient for going to most places in BCN. Pere Tarres, if you're listening, suggestions in order of importance: 1) Better lockers, please, use those digital locks you already have on all the room doors and use metal lockers. Being able to open everybody's locker with everybody's key is rediculous. 2) Laundry detergent dispenser - you can even make a killing like with those vending machines you have! 3) You need at least 2 more elevators or at the very least program that fucker better so it doesn't always go to timbuk2 when somebody actually has luggage they need to take up to their room."

The Hotel's manager showed very little consideration when we complained about this and she offered us some sort of 'help'. When we refused the 'help', she finally walked away threatening to charge us more for the 'upgrade' we had not requested. Finally, Hotelopia got in touch with them and asked them to stop bothering us. The same rude receptionist walked towards us the 3rd morning while we were having our breakfast to 'remind' us that we had to leave the room by 12 pm. We did not want to save any money, we just wanted not to re-pack, un-pack and re-pack in 3 days we stayed there and all we wanted is to get a good sleep/rest and breakfast without being bothered by the Hotel's rude staff."

I asked where a local care hire place was the next morning, only to be told 'we don't have that type of information'. No sorrys, no let me find it for you, nothing.    The radiator was jammed on in the amazingly hot position, in an already hot August.     There was no air conditioning, just a rickety old inadequate, noisy fan.    And the wi-fi was laughable, working only in fits and starts."

"6825","1. Location  - A short walk to the nearest Metro Station, about 5-10 minutes. Situated near plenty of Supermercats, where you can get basic groceries till 11pm. Not much traffic noise, but be careful when crossing roads as sometimes a green man walking doesn't mean it's always safe.     2. Rooms  - Spacious Rooms. Having two toilets were very handy and the balcony had a nice view.    3. Facilities  - Modern facilities available. Basic cooking utensils too as well as towels and some toiletries.    4. Service  - Excellent service: staff were friendly - happy to help. Easy to contact.   - Towels and bed sheets were changed every 2nd/3rd day, as well as a resupply of toilet roll.  - Granted permission to leave luggage temporarily at a secured room.    5. City Tax  Came to 17 Euros for 6 people. This amount will vary from place to place.    6. Other Comments  This is not to do with the hotel, but I feel it's worthwhile mentioning but be -very- wary of pickpockets when travelling by rail. Upon our arrival on the first train we got on, a group of girls tried to pickpocket us whilst we were boarding with our heavy luggage. This seemed like their normal ""working area"" as the confusion from scrambling on the train gives a perfect excuse to get close. I was fortunate enough to notice my pocket being felt that when I made a noise they scrambled off the train as the doors were closing leaving one of my friend's bags open. Luckily nothing was taken but the potential was very high. Two of the ladies were very youthful, they were also accompanied by an older lady.    It's also better to check the official website for this apartment as I believe they do offer Breakfast services when ordering on their site. Out of courtesy, I had given the category food 5/5 as the average score would've dropped if I had left it blank.      Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. The apartment is very modern, all European plugs, with not a bad location to begin exploring. There just needs to be some improvements towards the facilities, such as a lift to accommodate for heavy luggage, a stable temperature for hot water, additional seating and extra cooling/ventilation upon the other rooms."
"6826","1. Location  - Takes about 2h 30 to get to Girona airport via metro, train line and coach.    2. Rooms  - Air conditioned in the living room only, meaning other bedrooms were stuffy. No instructions in how to use the AirCon.  - Only four chairs available (excluding sofa) which made seating difficult, ultimately just sat on the sofa bed to compensate. One chair in particular felt very unstable and vulnerable to breaking.  - Double Bed was literally two beds aligned, as oppose to a King-sized bed.  - Lighting was fine everywhere except the living room, it was dim and ambient.    3. Facilities  - Intermittent hot water: was perfectly fine during the first day but after a while the water does have some trouble maintaining heat. Not just in the shower but in the kitchen sink too; when you want hot water you can hear the boiler beside the sink start up, but it takes about a minute before feeling any temperature. And then shortly after you can hear the boiler power down. Which means that you got about another few seconds -of hot water left.    - Similar situation in the shower, in occasion will it turn cold suddenly. But you just have to wait another 10 seconds for it to heat up again and within another minute it would repeat.    - Small bathroom toilet not fully secured in place, leans forward when you sit down.  - Lack of a lift made walking 4 floors difficult with luggage. Although there is a rope where you can tie your luggage to wrench up to the top floor, but it's a bit dangerous to operate.  - TV often had poor signal, and channels not accommodating for non-Spanish guests.  - Little washing up liquid available.

Although there is a rope where you can tie your luggage to wrench up to the top floor, but it's a bit dangerous to operate.  - TV often had poor signal, and channels not accommodating for non-Spanish guests.  - Little washing up liquid available.

The rooms are basic but clean (the cleaner comes every day, tidies up and leaves fresh towels).  We found all the staff friendly, kind and helpful. We stayed half board and although the food was a little similar each day, it was always enjoyable and plentiful. The overall atmosphere was calm and relaxing. The hotel is only a few minutes from the beach and shops, yet quiet enough at night. The Turkish Night was good fun and the boys enjoyed the pool table and hotel cats!

(To get here we rented a car and driver from Rostom Badrane tours - very happy with the trip (and their professionality), and we certainly recommend having a driver if you can find a good price. For 5 days from Fez to Essaouira prices seem to oscillate between 500 and 900 euro incl. petrol, car and driver). We were here during Ramadan but this wasn’t a problem at all!

"6915","There were a lot of good things about this hotel.  Room is spacious and has a good layout, staff were accommodating (allocating us a room on a high floor when we arrived to check in, (although they had ignored 2 previous email requests for this), rooms were made up every day when we returned, valet parking guys RUN for your car, buffet breakfast was lovely (omelette station, fresh made waffles and pancakes, fresh fruit, cereal, etc, etc) and a good deal for us as the kids ate free with vouchers we got at check-in - $40 - $50 for breakfast for 4, Starbucks serves ice cream up to 10pm (yum), food at pool bar is good, choice of pools around the lake (there are 5 - one with a lazy river, one with e water slide), view of Epcot fireworks and the lake itself is a lovely sight.  We stayed at the Hilton Bonnet Creek the previous 3 years and considered the Wyndham Grand because Hilton had increased room rate and added a resort fee, which doubled the cost.  I wasn't disappointed and we are planning a return trip to the Wyndham Grand next year."
"6916","Pool at hotel is small (compared to the Hilton), so can feel quite crowded when it's busy.  They could also use a few more parasols (they are few and far between).    Some of the sun loungers look like they have some mould developing on them (black spots) and some of them need to be protected from birds doing a bombing raid (the Hilton has some artificial bird noise that keeps them away - the Wyndham Grand does not).      Some of the pool side activities are more successful than other...glitter tattoos - good, pool side dancing - bad.    I don't know if there is an issue with sound proofing or if we just had rude neighbours, but we were twice woken early by a screaming child in the room next door (not a distressed child, a spoiled child) who was also running about the room and slamming doors.  On the second morning I called reception.  I don't know if it was co-incidence or if it was their intervention (they said they would send security), but the noise stopped.  We also had a noisy upstairs neighbour on one Saturday night - only 20 minutes but again, the issue for me was sound proofing.  Other than that no noise in a 15 night stay.    After 15 nights we wanted a late check-out (1pm instead of 11am) before our long return flight to the UK.  We were told we could have an hour.  That was cut to 30 minutes on the day of departure because the hotel was full.  Maid service works to 5pm, so I think if they had made a little effort they could have accommodated us, and they didn't, and that was disappointing.  In the end we left the room at 12.30pm and the maid hadn't appeared to make up the room, so it could  absolutely have been accommodated.    Food in the evening in the Tesoro restaurant is expensive - I'm sure it was $32 for a steak, didn't check-out the other restaurants on site, but you are 10 minutes in a car from hundreds of good places to eat, in all price brackets, so it's not an issue with staying here.    I hate the resort and parking fees, added $500 to our bill, but we knew it was coming.  Only place I have ever paid a resort fee and car parking charge.  Car parking in particular is just a money machine for Wyndham, and they're only able to do this because of the location of the hotel and the fact there are no other parking options.  It feels like they take advantage of you.  Whilst this won't put me off booking and staying again (I know the cost and it is what it is) it damages my loyalty to the brand."

Complained about the room, and were told we'd be moved to a more renovated room.  Packed up (a real hassle with 2 small kids), and ended up with the same exact conditions. Parking alone was $30!!!  This hotel is in need of major renovation....bad, bad, bad!  "

For the money this hotel is brilliant, in a great location about 20 mins walk from the old town and slightly further to the beach but right outside the Turia park. Also straight outside the hotel is a taxi rank which makes it easy if you don't wish to walk to the many great sights this city has to offer"

"7047","We think this hotel is a find.  We prefer it to some of the glitzier airport hotels where you must tip every time you do anything and it takes a major procedure to order your car - pay $30.00 each time and plus the tip.  Here we just walk 100 feet to the parking lot next door and get our own, just $8 a night.  The lobby area is lovely, and we enjoyed the restaurant, as well as the dancing lessons they present every single night! It has a much homeier feel and the price was definitely right.  The bathroom was bigger than usual and you could actually take a real bath in the bathtub. The shower was a cut above.  No big slabs of granite, but more well designed, and actual hooks on the doors. Everybody we met was really nice and has worked there for many years - a good sign.  A good feel to the place."

Please fix it - I'm a fan of the Owens River and hate to see it wasted like that."

"7217","Because we had booked through a third party and not directly with the hotel, we seemed to get lesser accommodations and meals.  Our first room  had a badly soiled and stained carpet, and warm water was only provided at certain hours of the day.  The lighting was bad, and only a trickle of water of cold water came through the shower.  We complained and  were moved to a much nicer room overlooking a gorgeous court yard -- no stained carpet, better lighting, decent water flow and hot water.  Our breakfast was only white bread toast, jam, coffee, and juice.  No eggs, fruit, or other offerings as we had had elsewhere in Peru.  The hotel had no useful maps or tourist information to give us.   The lobby and general areas are gorgeous. Overall, this hotel needs to:  upgrade the inferior rooms that have not yet been upgraded, provide a full breakfast to all, and have maps and other information readily available.  With these improvements this lovely facility would easily earn a ""4.""  The hotel is convenient to MALI (Museo de Arte de Lima) and to the lovely downtown plazas, and to the rapid metro system near the Sheraton which goes south to Mira Flores and other points.  Unfortunately, however, tourist oriented restaurants in this area are quite limited..  "

We also heard trash trucks early one morning, around 7 am, and other cars leaving the hotel parking lot. Basically, wear earplugs if you're sensitive to sound. We were required to pay a passport fee of $10 every day we stayed at the hotel, which we did not know about when we booked. The passport included a coupon book, internet access (which is usually free at hotels nowadays), a free 2 hour bike rental and some other things. It wasn't worth $10 a day. We ended up eating at Humphrey's one time because of the coupon book in hopes of recouping some of the cost. "

A frustrating arrival on 21 August, let us say. I have used this hotel for more than twenty years, yet remain unknown to them, given little consideration.

I have used the Hacienda satisfactorily for 20  years, will likely continue to do so, on arrival in LA, and the night before departure. Not a hotel I'd stay in more than one night at a time, though. The bell staff is very good, and the airport shuttle fine, every 15-20 minutes 24/24."
"7324","Reservation was not recognized, had to get out my portable computer and show that the reservation was made, and paid for. They tried to get me to pay a higher rate, and when I mentioned that I'd stayed there twelve days earlier, they insisted that I had been a no-show a day earlier, denied that I'd been there. A frustrating arrival on 21 August, let us say. I have used this hotel for more than twenty years, yet remain unknown to them, given little consideration. But it is a good deal, convenient and when things go right, worth knowing about."

"7348","We had prepaid for a room with sea view which we didn't get, and they said that all the rooms in the deluxe section were the same, with barely any sea view at all. We had to stand at the balcony and lean forward to see the sea at all. The staff explained it to be an info error caused by the travel agent Hotels.com. But the worst of all was that a family came into our room with their own room key while we were setling in our room, much to our shock. They left in a second but not once did we get any apology from any of your staff. That shouldn't be possible. And finally, at the dinner we were horrified that we had to pay extra to get water to drink, since the dinner was included in the whole package. From all our travellings to a number of restaurants, that's the first time we ever had to pay extra for water. Unprofessional. We saw several times that the cutlery and cups and plates were not cleaned properly."

"7453","We stayed at 2 different apartments - Janececk and one on the top floor (can't remember the name).  This was because we extended our stay an additional night at the last minute so the original apartment was already booked.    Very spacious with full accommodations in the kitchen.  Clean and quiet for the most part in a fairly nice area of town. Quick shopping and lost of restaurants nearby.  The staff was very good and worked with us to extend our stay.  They even offered to move our stuff from one apartment to the next!  Internet connectivity was terrific and they even gave us extra logins for our many devices!    The apartment on the top floor had more than enough room for our 3 teens and us with a roll away bed.  If it weren't for the top floor, I think I would recommend it over the Janaceck apartment just because you wouldn't have to hear the footsteps from the apartment above."

"7457","You get not the apartment you paid for. We paid for 5 persons and received an apartment for two.  After complaining they could only offer us an apartment with one bedroom with one two persons bed and two couches. The couches where metal staves stick out, which is very painful to sleep on.  After using the shower the floor outside the shower was completely wet which is very dangerous to glide. After complaining several times and after four days we could move to another apartment and again with less beds then we booked. For the breakfast you have to wait 50 minutes and was not served at once and not complete. (first jus d’orange 10 minutes later warm drinks 15 min later bread and croissants ) many times you have to arrange cutlery and serviette.  The equipment of the apartment is very bad. All the electrical devices (Airco, fridge and tv) are out of order.   The hot plates, water cooker were not available in the apartment and if you get one it is not working.  The towels are not available, you have to complain and beg for and get not one towel per person.   The towels are grubby and gabble.   Cleaning of the room was not done before 17:00 pm first you have to complain. Sometimes after 19:30 pm we have to complain that the apartment was not cleaned and the towels are not available.  In the hotel are vermin (cock-roach and lizard).  There is noise nuisance till late in the night.   The service is very bad and they do not provide you the service you ask for. When we ask for toilet paper or soap it takes more than half a day and you have to ask again for it before they arrange it.  WIFI was not available, we complain the first day and days after and after three days they fixed the WIFI and it was not always available and not steady.  The Airco in our bedroom was not working we complaint several times but they took no action. On our last evening they came and want to fix it which is too late after 9 days of complaining.  Several times a day we had no electricity in the whole hotel. They told us that the capacity of the electricity meter cupboard is not sufficient. Then on an Saturday morning there was no water in the whole hotel from 9:00 am till 15:00 pm. The hotel guests revolt and the police, representative of the ministry of tourism and a representative of the local authority came. The guests hand over their complaints.  Our Conclusion a very bad hotel. The manager and the hotel owner don’t provide the space (apartment and equipment) and service the guests paid for. This is Fraud!  "
"7458","You get not the apartment you paid for. We paid for 5 persons and received an apartment for two.  After complaining they could only offer us an apartment with one bedroom with one two persons bed and two couches. The couches where metal staves stick out, which is very painful to sleep on.  After using the shower the floor outside the shower was completely wet which is very dangerous to glide. After complaining several times and after four days we could move to another apartment and again with less beds then we booked. For the breakfast you have to wait 50 minutes and was not served at once and not complete. (first jus d’orange 10 minutes later warm drinks 15 min later bread and croissants ) many times you have to arrange cutlery and serviette.  The equipment of the apartment is very bad.

"7471","We stayed at this hotel last week for 5 days, The room we had was basic enough, probably could do with a make over very soon, no tea or coffee making facilities if you fancied a cuppa, It was fairly clean the maid came every morning and left it clean and tidy. The food was very very good, lots of variety and good selections of everything. We went half board and had a choice of lunch or Dinner on a particular day. The shows were ok for kids at night but did come on really late from 10 - 11 at night."
"7472","I found the staff here very unfriendly and their english was very bad, The reception staff seemed to have an awful attitude and quite abrupt at times,There was one guy in the bar part where the shows took place was very helpful and friendly, I heard he was there quite a long time he was the only person there that was friendly.  If you wanted your fridge turned on in your room you had to pay 21 euros including10 drinks, you would think this would be included inyour room price but not with this hotel. Their werent enough sunbeds at the pool either, their was a running match at 7.30 in the mornings to reserve sunbeds and you would never get one if you left it later, although the lifeguard would have lifted towels from their beds if they were empty for an hour but not very often.  The pools were quite deep also, Their is a baby pool as well although a lady told me she wouldnt let her kids into it as it doesnt be filtered.    We were checking out on saturday and our flights werent till late so we asked could we keep the room for a couple of hours, The guy on reception was so uptight and abrupt it was a definite 'NO'  staff altogether.    In general its just an ok hotel if you can speak spanish you'll be ok. Food was lovely and rooms were ok but clean and thats the main thing i suppose but I definitely wouldnt go back to this hotel.

The oustide pool was so relaxing especially after a long day at the beach.  I stupidly forgot my bikini at the villa, and asked my hotel at Sanur to call Dewani to see if they could post it to me.  Dewani actually dropped it the very next morning by 10am via scooter.  This was very surprising and I was so grateful that they would go to this trouble, as I'm sure it was more than 40 mins away.  All in all my stay here was a wonderful  to start off my adventures in Bali.  Thank you Dewani Villas."

"7629","Average score should be 4.4!! We did not eat in the hotel, therefore I did not rate it. But the system calculates it as a 0 and lowers the average score.    It is very well located: 10 minutes walking from the beach; 2 blocks from the metro L4 (yellow) and 3 from L1 (red); Bus lines that goes directly into town centre (Placa de Catalunya).  The hotel is very spacious and has a good infrastructure.  The room is has good facilities (clean bathroom with shower in the bathtub, toilet and bidet), HD television (not that you need it!) and an air-conditioning that works.  The staff is friendly and always ready to help!"

After negotiating with the manager we were able to settle for a deposit €50 in total, but they emptied the mini-bar and we were not allowed to put anything on the room (pay for the drinks at the bar).

They are very friendly to other Cubans however and not all of them were unfriendly, Kareina, at the front desk, was very helpful, everyone else however seemed to be stoned and extremely disinterested, they never said thank you or even handed requested documentantation/change etc to me in person, they just put it on the desk and walked off, leaving us feel like we did something wrong each time, we always spoke Spanish to them and were very mannerly so there was no problem from our side. If you're European/Canadian expect to be treated like dirt at the front desk. I would suggest Almeria Americas instead, we also stayed there for a week and it was far friendlier, and better all round. "

So if it were just about the room itself it would have been great. Maybe with the exception of the bed which was super soft (some people like it, we don't).     Unfortunately, the room was in a tower - on the corner of 2 busy streets. We heard trams, scooters and cars, as well as loud shouts from the nearby pubs all night. My partner could not sleep at all. Th next day we asked to be placed in a room in the back. Which was very quiet. And also very nice - if smaller, with a bathroom in a separate room (some rooms I heard have the bathroom and toilet ""in"" the room - divided up with glass only. The bed was also very soft ad i found it uncomfortable, despite us having removed the even-softer mattress cover.     The breakfast was EXCELLENT, in their hip restaurant MOMO. Our rate included it, otherwise it costs 23 EUR pp which is a lot, but that breakfast was worth it. Very wide spread of cheeses, cold cuts, made-to-order eggs and so on, excellent coffee, pastries, fruit, local dutch sweet specialties. Very very good and in a cool environment.

The 35th floor has high ceilings so the room felt very spacious, and the small balcony had wonderful views of the beach and coastline. There were lots of renovations in the main lobby during our stay, and this impacted a little on the chaos at checkin, but wasn't anything major. The Village is HUGE and there is lots of food choices (although the more convenient to-go options are very overpriced), and the japanese we had was fresh and good value. The ability to quick-check-out and not visit the front desk saved us a lot of time, and we generally found staff helpful and friendly. Overall a good stay. "

I prepaid my room but when I checked out they asked me to pay 50% more because they said the rate I booked was wrong. This hotel has a management problem and they will try to scam you. Make sure you don't let them take a deposit from you or scan your credit card. They will scam you."

Once we called reception no apologies etc. The cleaning lady started to clean it but she just pick up those 3 hairs we showed her and left. So had to clean it myself. Very strange smell when entering the lobby sort of ""public toilet"" smell. Rooms are out dated and small.   Definitely not worth to hold 4 stars!!!"

However I was very disappointed in the attitude of the staff at the reception. I booked the room online and I have received the confirmation and the receipt after using my personal credit card. I checked in the hotel in that day and after 2hrs I received a call from the reception telling me that I had a FRAUD issue with my credit card and that I have to pay the price of the room again with cash. I explained the situation and showed the receipts, and instead of solving the issue with the agent they asked me to call numbers and send emails by myself claiming that they have no relation to the agent and that is entirely my problem. I was about to have a very important interview that day, so I was very upset they were bothering me every 2 minutes with the same topic instead of doing their job. Finally I agreed to pay only to get rid of sending emails and wasting my time and they asked me to pay the room AT A HIGHER RATE than the one I paid initially. The problem was solved finally, but they kept giving me a suspicious stare which made me feel very uncomfortable. Very very bad attitude towards clients...."

My daughter loved the Rixy Club, The beach was nice and clean. We also had a complimentary Water Taxi Ride to Dubai Marina Mall. That was nice.  Taxi from Resort back to my hotel in Diera was 85 AED. The shuttle bus was full so we had to take a taxi.  So in summary, yes, all went well.   One more thing, breakfast was really nice. Dinner was good, no faults but some space for more intercontinental variety.  Kudos Rixos ....... Any questions, pls ask me: otunbajesu@gmail.com"

My daughter loved the Rixy Club, The beach was nice and clean. We also had a complimentary Water Taxi Ride to Dubai Marina Mall. That was nice.  Taxi from Resort back to my hotel in Diera was 85 AED. The shuttle bus was full so we had to take a taxi.  So in summary, yes, all went well.   One more thing, breakfast was really nice. Dinner was good, no faults but some space for more intercontinental variety.  Kudos Rixos ....... Any questions, pls ask me: otunbajesu@gmail.com"
"8051","Fantastic place to stay; the attention to detail was outstanding!  I can't stress enough how well designed everything was.  An incredibly well designed place to stay with great location for a train out of Gare du Nord or l'Est.  Everything was super clean and quiet.  The breakfast was brilliant as well.  We will definitely be staying next time we visit Paris."

"8053","Easy check-in, polite staff and very quiet which we all liked. The pool was a bit on the small side considering the size of the hotel, but this really didn't matter as the majority of occupants were at the parks it seemed! Breakfast was plentiful every time we visited and well stocked with eggs, sausage, fruit (bananas and oranges), toast, cereals, yogurt, pastries, bagels and make your own pancakes ! Excellent location with Sizzler, Ponderosa and McDonalds to name a few in walking distance, and approx 10mins drive to Disney area ! Would use again but upgrade to a suite, just to enable us to put children to bed and for us to be able to sit down and relax. "

We waited a further 25 minutes for our ordered breakfast to no avail, on asking we were told there had been a mistake, we were forgotten about and were getting nothing.  we eventually did get breakfast and it was meagre in portion, one sausage, one slice bacon, one small teaspoon of beans, they forgot the tomato.  Certainly not worth the money that is paid.  they also claim to give you free wifi but it was unobtainable in our room and we had to move down to reception to get it, which defeats the purpose."

You have to pay for parking at a cost of £7 for 5pm to 11am and then £1 for each hour outside this. Factor this into your hotel costs!  A tip - arrive well before 'bingo' hours as there is a bingo hall next door and finding a parking place is much harder at this time."

"8413","Room was great we had 4th floor with view over the river and the church on the square behind was very nice! Room was always clean, beds turned down everyday, new towels each day, brand new lift so feel a lot better that you won't get stuck. Breakfast room was bright warm quite refreshing with seems like traditional decoration. The most important things here are: you are 10min casual walk to Old Town Square, about 15min walk to New Town, about 10min to Charles Bridge, there is an off license on the corner and the shopping centre with a HUGE transport hub right underneath it, literally buses, teams, subway, and an easy link if you wish to the overland rail. Fantastic location for this hotel we are planning to go again. "
"8414","Ok it's hard to pick negatives so il be a bit picky just to be fair on both sides. Duvet was slightly small for a 6'1 male. Pillow isn't fantastic but I had some of the best nights sleep ive had in months in that bed. Now if there is 1 thing I could be picky with..... It is breakfast. It is adaquet. It fills the gap. Needs a bit of improvement, especially on hot food, I don't like cold mushrooms with my toast and sausage and egg. So a few extra hot options would be good, as it's only toast and the local sausage which is Beef for anyone wondering had to check at a local shop. Oh 1 big thing which isn't that big. When you check in there's this form which encourages you to use the safe, we didn't (had no trouble) it's just the form is scare tacticstheu want you to hand in the pick everytime you leave the hotel but really with the bad reviews of the City with crime we took ours everywhere just to be safe, hotels always have a master just in case you'd lose it, and there is no name on the key so you don't need to worry about losing it and your room being ransacked. Overall great hotel. "

From checking in with the excellent (Manatelli - apologise as not sure of spelling but she is from Belgium) who gave good information and was always very pleasant to talk to and smiling as we entered or departed from the hotel. She also set Wi-Fi up on my iphone which worked well in the bedroom.The other reception staff were also very good too. Breakfast was good and Alice in particular here was always welcoming and excellent in the breakfast room working hard yet still smiled.    The bedrooms we had were spotlessly clean so the housing keeping was top notch. Our rooms faced the back but were so quiet we slept very well. The TV offered many channels and BBC1, 2 and Channel 5 if you wished to see what was going on in the UK.    The big plus for the hotel is the location, making it convenient for the Old Town, the sea front and airport bus.     On day of leaving the hotel has a baggage storage area like many other hotels, but at this hotel they also offered a room to freshen up and change clothes in prior departing which was very welcome.    A hotel to stay again in the future although a little pricey."

There were 2 other bungalows in our block sharing our very decent sized pool but we were the only ones to use the pool. I would recommend paying a bit more for a room like this.

Again there was nothing the matter with it, it just wasn't 5 star. So even though we had paid for half board we ate out......we wondered down to the harbour to it's traditional tavernas with local Cretan food which were fabulous and reasonably priced and got a taxi to Agios Nik and Plaka a couple of nights which were also great and only a few mins away by cab. Don't let this put you off going, we would definitely still return....buffet food and all."

Staff: Although we had called after making the reservation to request for a double bed as opposed to two singles and being assured by the lady on the phone that it was not a problem, upon our arrival we discovered we were placed in a room with a double bed on which two single mattresses were placed next to each other. We arrived late after our trip around 10pm and were not pleased we had to go back to reception to ask for a change of rooms but luckily they served us quickly and our room was switched to one with a proper double bed.    Furthermore, on the one out of the seven nights we decided to stay in, we discovered that there were no English channels on the TV apart from the news (BBC I think). We thought that we could rent a movie so we called the reception to ask whether the hotel provided  that service.

This one can be accessed by visitors to Damai Central, a collection of small shops a cafes which is becoming increasingly popular with locals and is so close to the resort that you do not feel 'secluded' by any means.  Recommend some of the nearby jungle treks, especially the ones you can do with a cheap day pass at Permai Rainforest Resort.  The Sarawak Cultural Village is worth a visit too - short walk away. For a real slice of life in a (poor) Malay fishing village, spend a few late afternoon hours at Kampong Buntal, about 10ks away.  The villagers are so friendly and great food s served at a large Chinese seafood restaurant there.  Very basic surroundings, but good to watch the sunset with super food.  Don't go if you do not like to stray outside your comfort zone and prefer to eat in hotels.  Do go if you like local experiences."
"8778","Stayed for last 2 nights of our fortnight's trip. Glad it wasn't any longer. Staying on Santubong Peninsula is a must, but if you will only be staying at one resort there, make it the Permai Rainforest Resort not this one or Damai Resort and Spa.  The latter two are trading ln their names.  The Damai Beach Resort is 3 star at best.  They were doing some refurbishment work to one of the pools when we stayed and building in another area, which I have disregarded for this review because we knew about this work beforehand.  That said, the facilities and front area of this resort are nothing spectacular.  Stayed in a beach cabin which was dated, but large - very 1970s.  Note that you do not get a detached chalet to yourself.  There are 3 to 4 cabin rooms per detached chalet, which are basic.  They do interconnect if you are a family group.  Only 6-8 cabin rooms have uninterrupted views of the beach - if you can't get one of these, don't bother.  You will simply be staring at other chalets.  Better off with a hilltop room which would afford a sea view from a distance.  Also note that some cabin rooms are larger than others.  No. 313 is big, no. 314 is much smaller.  Our bed was old and sagged a bit.  Pillows were hard and uncomfortable.  Air con was good.  No real hot water.  Buffet breakfast was just okay if you pick and choose.  We had a poor quality meal in the hilltop restaurant.  Hotel has too many 'don't do' notices and makes you feel uncomfortable.  Don't know what sort of guests they attract, but you certainly feel as though they don't trust/respect you.  There's even a notice at breakfast which threatens to charge you 10 RM for every 100 grams of food you don't eat!  Staff were friendly and helpful, but lose marks because they must be aware of these issues.  All in all, I wouldn't stay again or recommend you do.  No problems with Hotelopia's service."

On the Saturday there was a wedding and all the service staff seemed to be running around doing something for that. I had been told that the hotel does not do room service. I asked for some lunch at the bar and after a long wait I was given the snack menu. I saw the lunch menu on the website before I went downstairs, but when I asked for it I was told that snacks was all they had. The restaurant was being used be the piper to tune up. I had a sandwich at the bar. The staff were very friendly and professional, but lost and inexperienced. The correct training in all departments would help the staff and let the customers feel safe in their hands.   When the music started for the wedding I was already preparing for bed. I had to work very early the next day. The music was very load and I had to sleep. There was a lot of people and children outside making a lot of noise. Luckily I had earplugs, and I was able to sleep.   For a quite out of town hotel, it was on of the loudest I have stayed in.  "

I explained to her that the plate was dirty and thats why it was there. It was obvious by her manner after that, she was not happy with us. She asked us what we wanted to drink but never offered a refill and was quite off putting. The next morning we made sure we were sat in a different part and were served by a much more pleasant person who made sure we were satisfied. We do not normally complain as this often leads to bad feelings and spoils a weekend away but we will not be using this hotel again. Certain staff members need to be better trained."

My waiter approached the table, looked at my dish and asked 'Beef? Pork?' It was beef...  If you were kind, you'd describe the décor as careworn. If you were harsh, you'd just describe it as worn.  (Why do hotels - not just this one - not give a discount for a second night when they don't have to change the towels, supply fresh sheets or replace the soap and other toiletries?)  I didn't pay full rate, but if I had, I would have felt well and truly done."

The young man was unsure of that day's menu and suggested we take a look at the restaurant to see what was on. He also had no idea of the bus route and bus stop into Oxford or, if there was a bus that could take us to the railway station on departure.   We then discovered there was no lift or elevator to get the cases up to the bedrooms, difficult for elderly guests. Our bedroom was perfectly clean and my only complaint was the net curtains were in need of a good wash. O.K. it's end of season, but the standard must be kept up. The other thing was not enough milk provided for two people, one needs a little more than one tiny capsule per cup."

Good suggestion-try their food -buffet,you may find its better than the local restaurants,and better value for money too.  What else do you need or want?

I mean that i didnt want to spend much time to this issue in the last days of my holidays. In the result i came in the day before last. Reception stuff asked all the details (number room, time and so on) and then asked to come next day after 09:00. I came at 09:00 then waited for 20 mins for manager arriving then we spent 30 mins more in discusiions is it possible to orginize late check out or not. In the end they gave to my family another number till 17:00 (for additional payment - but thats is absolutely ok). The only my complain is the time i spent - about 1 hour in total. This issue is needed to be better orginized - i suppose that i am not the only who requested this service."

We were sat outside in the evening and at 11pm promtly we were asked to go inside......it was like being told to go to bed when i was a child!

"9516","I booked a 2 bedroom apartment and ended up with a 1 bedroom very small ""apartment"", i felt ripped off as soon as i entered the room.

I have stayed in much nicer places in Brisbane and got great value for money. in this case it definitely was false advertising."

"9577","Hi, although the Senator Suite room with extra bed has old furniture, my family liked it alot due to the space of the bedroom, the living room and the bathroom- clean and with no molds. The beds including the extra one was comfortable. The view was amazing too. and like the idea of one flat screen in the bedroom and one for in the living room.-there is even a DVD player altho we did not use it.        Breakfast is not bad especially at rm23 per pax. Get the extra breakfast when you check it as it is more worthwhile rather than walk-through in the morning ( they charged rm 37 per pax if your do). Like the roti canai station and the sambal of the nasi lemak is quite good too.    Swimming pool is a bit chilly, and the ambiance is a like in the 70's- but atleast it is clean.    Overall, it is not a 4-5 star hotel in a real sense, but an acceptable 2 and half start joint. may be a little pricey but it is convenient with the attractions nearby and with lift connected from room floors to the carpark basement.    I do like the convenience and like to stress it is acceptable if you are not fussy and I might be the lucky one to have a good room :)"

Breakfast is a buffet with a good selection of cereals, fruits, breads, meat, cheeses, jams, honey etc. and drinks that beats most breakfasts that would be charged well over 5 Euros each for an inferior offering at other places - at the Silvia it is all included. All that plus a bar, a lounge area for relaxing a lift to all floors and a central town location in a non too busy Rhodes street. Location handy for the main harbours (short cheap taxi ride if you've cases), close to the edge of the old town, a cafe (serving great and cheap souvlaki/gyros) and a supermarket.

At peak time we had to wait a long time for lifts to come, one of the lifts didn't have a light for more than 3 days and although clients complained  nothing was being done, which it was quite scary as it was completely dark and you have to bear in mind is the tallest building in Benidorm!"

"9659","When we arrived to our room, it was HOT and I couldn't adjust the air conditioning. I've called the reception 2-3 times and although they had promised to send a technician, nobody arrived. The restaurant was the noisiest experience I've ever had in my life. The staff were racing their carts through tables to carry dirty plates around and  the volume of the music was just terrible. The guests, mostly Russian, were walking around the reception hall with swimwear and laying around on leather chairs which I consider not appropriate at all. When I mentioned to the staff at the reception, their answer was that, ""This is a spa hotel and the guests can behave as they like"". Totally, just 1  night only was more than enough and wouldn't recommend to anyone, if the hotel doesn't change their attitude.    "

"9698","The breakfast could have had more variety, I Think, it consisted only of pancakes, some pieces of bread, and cakes. So, if you are on a healthy diet you really need to take care of your own breakfast. If you are a woman and travelling with a female friend, like I was, you need to Think about some vital things when you are going out at nights. In the Medina, where the riad is, you cannot ""easily"" go out at nights. The area is poor and of a lower class, people (men) stare at you and you have to cover yourself - at nights you have to be more careful. People, Tourists and even Moroccans, go out in Gueliz area, where all the nice places are (restaurants, nightclubs etc). If you want to put on a nice dress on to go out at night you need to Contact a driver/taxi driver and make sure that he comes to the front door of the riad and Escort you to the main road where he parks his car. There is a small road (2-3 min walk) from the main road (Kasbah street) to the riad where it is difficult for a car to drive in. You don't want to walk on these streets with a short skirt on, for instance. So, make sure that the driver comes to the door to pick you up and Escort you. Whatever you do, make sure that you agree on the price BEFORE you enter the car. Taxi drivers have a tendency to ""forget"" details. My advice is to find someone that you Think is ok and call him every time you want to go somewhere by taxi, they will be more than happy to assist you then.   "

Some of the guides were better than others. We thought that some management of the safari trips would benefit customers so that they knew in advance the expected animals to be seen on each trip to avoid duplication and holding back more seasoned travellers. The caves were listed as starting at 9.30 a.m. but actually commenced 7a.m."

The only let down was the food in the restaurant- fine, but there are much better options 2 mins down the beach, and the helpfulness of the staff. Whilst they were eager to help, information you would expect to be readily available i.e. whether we had already paid for our room, up to date times of local boats to Cebu etc was not to hand and took rather too long to obtain. This resort has so much going for it, again just needs to work on a few areas to make it an exceptional recommendation.  "

Gross.  The second night, my child again went into the bathroom to shower, and there was a USED tampon applicator on the floor that had blood on the tip.  DISGUSTING.  If the room was cleaned, how on earth was that missed?  We reported this to the front desk, who ensured us it would be passed along to the next manager on duty, but of course we never heard back from anyone about it.

Don't let it put you off though!  Only other (v minor) gripe was there is no towel rail for large wet bath sheets!  hooks in shower area are too slippy!"

Dewa was our host and was so friendly and helpful, and we also enjoyed chatting to the hotel manager and all the lovely waiters and waitresses in the restaurants, including Sudomo who was lovely at breakfast. Our villa was spectacular and they went to a great effort to make it extra special for us as we were on our honeymoon.     Unfortunately I was unwell during our stay (nothing to do with the hotel at all) and the staff were incredibly helpful in bringing me everything I needed to recover, which made a huge difference - including baking me food that I fancied specially to help build up my strength. I had also registered with them as gluten free and they always remembered to check and ensure that my food was correct.    The free shuttle bus service they provide is also a real bonus - they will take you to any part of Ubud and come and collect you at any time, with very short notice.    We would really recommend the Samaya to anybody thinking of staying there - we loved it."

"10413","Hotel 28 is located on the outskirts of Kamara village about 10 minutes walk from the beach and well away from the noise and bustle of the beach front area.  The swimming pool is clean and surrounded by 16 double sun beds.  This should be ample for 28 rooms but some people still insist on going out early to reserve a bed.  Five of the beds are in permanent shade whilst the others are in the sun either in the morning or afternoon.  There is a pool bar open all day selling drinks and snacks at typical Kamara prices.  The garden area is small.  There is plenty of space for parking.    Breakfast is a buffet of fruit, cereal, scrambled or hard boiled eggs and either bacon or small sausages plus bread and toast, cake, fruit juice tea and coffee.  It can be eaten either inside or out on the balcony.    The rooms are a reasonable size, painted white and nicely designed with a sink in the bedroom and the shower and toilet in the bathroom.   The wardrobe has plenty of clothes hangers and shelf space for clothes.  The air-conditioning is effective and quiet.  All 28 rooms are in a single block on three floors.  The ground floor is partly below ground level.  Views from rooms on one side are of the pool and the other side of a small holding (farm).     Most guests seemed to be on their second, third etc visit.  I suspect the reason for this is the three front of house ladies, Aggie, Dimi and Joanna who are always cheerful and willing to do everything to make your stay a happy and memorable one.

I asked the concierge for help in getting a visa to Thailand, which is a service that most travel agents in Penang will do and I have done through many hotels in Penang.  The concierge told me that this service does not exist; I asked if he knew any travel agents on Chuia Street, and he told me that I have to go to the embassy myself.  It's one thing to not know, but I found this unhelpful and rude.  When I went to Chuia Street, the first travel agency I saw was able to provide the service and they said they would have gone to the hotel to collect my passport which would have been nice because EVERY taxi in Penang will overcharge foreigners and refuse to turn on the meter.    Overall, I found this experience frustrating both with hotelopia and G Hotel.  If I was provided with what is promised and what is standard for a hotel, I would have enjoyed my stay.  But, I see a couple of months of arguing ahead as I am not going to pay for nights that I did not spend in a hotel that advertises a pool that is closed... You cannot swim on the beach at the hotel and I was not interested in spending six days at the mall.          "

When I went to Chuia Street, the first travel agency I saw was able to provide the service and they said they would have gone to the hotel to collect my passport which would have been nice because EVERY taxi in Penang will overcharge foreigners and refuse to turn on the meter.    Overall, I found this experience frustrating both with hotelopia and G Hotel.  If I was provided with what is promised and what is standard for a hotel, I would have enjoyed my stay.  But, I see a couple of months of arguing ahead as I am not going to pay for nights that I did not spend in a hotel that advertises a pool that is closed... You cannot swim on the beach at the hotel and I was not interested in spending six days at the mall.          "

"10483","I used to stay at this hotel years ago and it was a fabulous hotel....definitely worthy of the 4 star rating. I was disappointed and shocked at the current state of it. It's quite dirty (carpets, baseboard, walls) and has a very musty smell, despite the rooms being cleaned on a regular basis.  The staff at the bar seemed inconvenienced that we were there and the bar nuts were so stale that they were inedible.     We were originally put on a smoking floor in a smoking room (despite indicating an allergy to smoke) and the staff tried to convince us that you could not smell the smoke. It was like walking into a bar at 4am....with years of smoke seeping through the walls.    Thankfully the hotel is being made into a Doubletree at some point. Until such time, I would not recommend this hotel at all. Sad to see what was once a great hotel weathered by age and neglect. But then again, as my friend said ""Yeah, I used to be a 4 star ten year's ago also"" :) "

There was an alternative menu but that was only for while you sat on your sun lounger.

"10721","We arrived at 12pm to find that we could not check-in until 3pm. This was bad enough without the rude, defensive attitude of the staff. There was a sign saying that we could pay 10 pounds extra for a sea view, we asked the bored receptionist if we ha a room with a sea view to which she answered no. We did not bother to pay the extra money as at the point we'd decided that we would be spending as little time as possible at the hotel, we took our bags and tried to find something to do for the next few hours. We were not even invited to wait in the lobby or told about anything we could do whilst waiting    We came back to the hotel at 2.55pm to a huge queue. The staff were still rude,  and unhelpful, and after receiving our our keys we went up the the 160 per night room. It was like taking a trip back to the 80's, the decor was extremely dated, the soft furnishing were dirty and smelled musty, the curtains were so old and uncared for that they had been belched by the sun, the wood works/furniture were peeling and warped by years of cleaning and the carpet was filthy. The receptionist had lied as we did indeed have a sea view and would have paid 10pounds extra for something we already had.    In the end, we stayed at a friends house on her sofa bed rather than face rude staff members and unclean conditions.    We will NEVER go back to this hotel again and will make sure we warn anyone else not to.  "

"10762","We were exceptionally happy with the hotel, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. As I said already in my assessment, Judy Chen on the reception went out of her  to help us with any request we made, such as writing instructions in Mandarin to show the taxi driver, and showing us on the map where various places were. This was my third time in Shanghai and I always recommend your hotel as the best place to stay to friends as it is so central and right in the middle of the French Concession. "

As there were traces of scrambled egg on the plate as well as the sausages this was not apparent to other customers.  We have never seen this before and will not see it again as we will not stay at an hotel with such a policy"

"10792","Staff was very unfriendly when it came to ordering a taxi. Knowing that I have to reach the airport at the certain time they kept saying it's Sunday, so they can't guarantee I will get the cab on time. I decided to take care of the transportation myself in this case."
"10793","The trainie staff who was on the desk was very friendly and helpful (even when myself and brother couldn't work the door key). The beds and chairs in the room are really comfortable and the bathroom was clean, i can't comment on the food from here as we didn't eat at the hotel. There was no noise from outside the room which meant a quiet night sleep. Overall, I would happily stay there again and recommend it!

"10795","I had a really good stay at the hotel. After reading reviews about the hotel reception staff and the breakfasts I wasn't expecting too much but I was very impressed. I would certainly consider this hotel again if I want to revisit Birmingham."
"10796","The connecting rooms were noisy especially at night. Some of the cuttlery and plates weren't properly cleaned, but it was very busy when we stayed there."
"10797","Wonderful to arrive to smiling faces, friendly and helpful staff and to find a spacious, comfortable room well supplied with all necessities (which are totally absent in many European hotels). We would definitely stay here again."
"10798","The pool area being closed was a minor inconvenience and totally understandable as the hotel is under renovation. Amazingly this was the only inconvenience."
"10799"," Excellent gym, free weights and machines as well as cardio.   Hotel staff very professional and helpful.   Very quiet rooms.  Excellent location, close to everything. "

"10802","Twin beds nasty gap in middle ugh!"
"10803","Friendly, helpful staff who smiled and acted politely. Immensely hard working entertainment team who helped make my children's holiday even better. Great location, good selection of food -- only rated 4 since it seemed that some of the food was recycled or simply left over from earlier meal times. But even so, the choice was varied, tasty and plentiful. They catered for a diverse clientele, chips and burgers were not prominent, fish, meats and salads were."
"10804","Noise attenuation between apartments was poor, but that would be the same for many apartment blocks. The main pool is shaded for much of the day and thus too cold to be inviting; it was rarely used by most guests. The kids' pool however was perfect for our needs, as was the small beach immediately adjacent. "
"10805","after reading reviews quite worried, but pleasantly surprised, yes area is not the best but its a city centre location if you are used to world cities its fine never felt unsafe and walked back at 4am.   staff when we arrived very early morning were fantastic and that welcome made our stay, room basic but very clean and tidy, yes little noisy but again its city ccentre . hotel is 3mins from omonia metro so youcan explore very easily,  do not go off bad comments the price location and service were fantastic, yes little noisy are bit scruffy but its a city centre location not monte carlo bay so go expecting a city just like london new york or rome"
"10806","breakfast ok and a bit chaotic at peak time but perfectly adequate,"
"10807","Incredibly friendly staff.  It was nice to be welcomed with a cold drink and face towel on such a hot day.  Beautiful, clean well-appointed rooms which were well maintained during our stay.  Fun activities to choose from.  Large range of restaurants to choose from.  Magnificent pools.  Access to facilities at the adjoining resorts mean you essentially are staying at a hotel three times larger than normal.  I would definitely recommend this resort."
"10808","Wi-Fi availability was poor - very slow.  Restaurant prices are very high.  Better value can be obtained by taking a $5 taxi to Port Denarau and dining at one of the restaurants there."
"10809","nothing positive "
"10810","every thing negative"
"10811","We were upgraded to a 2-bedroomed suite, it was like living in an apartment. The furnishings were good and there was a fridge and three a/c units! We shut one bedroom off and lived in the rest. The hotel is pretty new and therefore it is in good condition, the exterior is quite impressive and the lobby too. the staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. Below I will set out the negatives, though, it did not stop us booking 3 more nights there, and yes, I would stay there again and reccomendt it as I am hoping that the management will pick up on the criticism and apply measures to amend them which will turn this (in my opinion) from a decent hotel into a very good one. On another site by the  there was mention that the Simfoni was next to a Chinese cremetorium, if there is one we could not find it..."
"10812","The first thing, starting from the room is simple, but easy to fix. the TV, it has only 5 local channels and they are not tuned in well at all.  The Hotel is a good walk from town, but we are walkers and it poses no problems and the taxi is only 10 ringett if you are struggling.  The breakfast is poor for western tastes and if reviews like this continue the hotel may not attract western accustomed bookings. The staff, and there is no shortage of them, lack leadership in the dining area. the food caters for local tastes and even they must wonder at the lack of choice, One other thing, FIRE ESCAPES! There are 2 lifts, next to each other and there are no shortage of stairs in the Simfoni, the trouble is they ALL lead to locked doors! WHO UNLOCKS them in an emergancy? TAKE NOTE HOTELOPIA and MANAGEMENT. Make this the hotel it has the potential to be."
"10813","On the beach, centrally located, with clean rooms. Best water pressure I ever experienced in a hotel shower. Taxi drivers right outside the hotel. Great price!"
"10814","They said the hotel was at full capacity, so they didn't have any extra towels. There was only 2 people in the room, so we got 2 towels, they changed them every day, but you had to wait or call to get the replacement towels. No washcloths, and the towels were frayed. Stayed last week in Sept., thus, offseason. Only get Wi-Fi at the hotel bar. "
"10815","Lovely. Very quiet as described. Lovely staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Exactly as reviewed elsewhere highly reccomended"
"10816","None - except for the crowing of the cockerels in the morning which was often before dawn but that's due to the farms in the area"
"10817","- No lift for guests, its only for luggage. Have to climb 2-3 floors  - b/f is very basic, could be improved  - no assistance for city tour, guide etc from staff  - no coffee machine in room (may be not by Italian tradition)"
"10818","A beautiful hotel living up to the title of ""Royal"" Highly recommended."
"10819","We stayed here for one night when we visited Clearwater. A room for 4 of us only cost £50.00, for what we paid the hotel was faultless, it was right on the beach, no problems with parking and the staff were extremely helpful - nothing was too much trouble for them. would definitely stay here again."
"10820","Absolutely Awesome!! This hotel is definitely worth the money!! Super super cheap but really good. We have never stayed in such a nice complex! "
"10821","Booking through Hotelopia was excellent value. Paid budget hotel price and obtained five star service. Reception staff efficient and welcoming. Even gave us upgrade to Business Class room which would have cost €323 for the night if booked at the hotel.  Excellent evening meal and breakfast at the Vie En Rose restaurant.  Free shuttle bus to airport. All good! "
"10822","nice clean freindly "
"10823","The hotel was in a fantastic location. The rooms were different but that is what I loved about it. The pool closed rather early in the evening which was disappointing-6pm. The brunch looked incredible but actually never had any food in the hotel."
"10824","I couldn't find anything negative in the hotel.  If I would I would gladly tell, but is a very good place to stay."
"10825","Very nice hotel .  Loveley position Well worth a visit. Try the weekly special meal ,good value for money"
"10826","Stayed in the hotel 29 August to 2 September. Standard room shower leaking any ware but the bath( which was really cramped). Worst of all loud banging music (even though we were on the sixth floor) upto 3am. Surprised to see the Hotel achived 4 stars. I would recomend 2, and if you want to sleep then find another hotel."
"10827","We arrived at 9pm and had paid for an evening meal we were told that the restaurant closed at 8pm but they made us sandwiches and delivered them to our room at no charge."
"10828","Nowhere on there site does it say what time the restaurant closes in the evening. Hotel is looking shabby and could do with an overhaul but cheap and cheerful. If you are looking to stay in a posh hotel dont book here but if you are after somewhere for a night or two that doesn't cost the earth it's fine. "
"10829","Room is comfortable staff are helpful, the free shuttle to disney is essential! "
"10830","Breakfast - stick with continental breakfast, try and eat in the main restaurant not the overshoot restaurant on the other side.  Otherwise it is good value and very efficient"
"10831","Real close to the beach"
"10832","All the rooms located at the older part of the building, needs a deep general cleaning supervised by the housekeeping manager. Especially the carpets through out the entire property the reason I am in the hotel buisness my self a dirty hotel room is a Sin!"
"10833","Room was not good even though the price was expensive.."
"10834","Immaculate. Very friendly staff. Amazing location. "
"10835","We spent a week here in Sept and we absolutely loved it. The staff were amazing, so friendly and helpful. The hotel was spotless and facilities modern and efficient. We don't normally stay by the pool but the pool was lovely and so relaxed and great having snacks and drinks available. The main menu was very good. Leylur was extremely obliging and runs the hotel very well. We will definitely be back and thoroughly recommend it."
"10836","Our only disappointment was the half board food [set menu]. It was rather boring and tended to repeat itself, very cheap though. We ate out a few nights. I would have rather paid more for a better menu."
"10837","Took over one hour to check in, new receptionist that was finding it difficult with so many Spanish, dinning room crazy on first morning. Could tell they were ready to close areas for winter season."
"10838","Hotel is in a very good location just a block or so walk from the beach. Close to good shopping, cafes,  Restaurants and just next door to the night markets. Staff were helpful, friendly and obliging. Concierge desk  Offered good information and helpful service. The convenience store in hotel lobby was a bonus also."
"10839","Three of us staying in the room but only ever offered us two towels. We had to ask each day for more.  The bathroom is a little small and cramped although the room itself was quite adequate. "
"10840","good location"
"10841","Great location in Clearwater. Hotel is right on the beautiful beach.   Had a live band on the terrace on Saturday and Sunday afternoon.  If I was to return to clearwater I would defiantly stay at this hotel."
"10842","Very impressed with facilities, great value for money, would use again"
"10843","Close to city centre, about 15 minutes on foot (and downhill). Good breakfast, fair choice of food and drink."
"10844","Carpet in the room needs a wash badly, not many English/international channels compared to other hotels in Portugal. Wi-Fi only available in common areas and not the rooms. Breakfast room very small, had to wait for a table to become available."
"10845","Nice location, right in the middle of the city. Close to Cadiz (10 km). Plenty of bars in the area, with excellent food. Car parking available (although a little expensive). Internet in the room, with excellent speed. Friendly and helptul staff (although speaking English was a challenge for them). Excellent breakfast! "
"10846","Difficult to reach by car, as it is placed in a sqare closed to cars (but we managed to get there). You can only visit Cadiz if you have a car. Difficult to find parking (but hotel parking available)."
"10847","Easy access to all the good restaurants. Ideally situated for the amenities. Value for money budget hotel."
"10848","Cleanliness needs to be addressed. Bathroom needs attention desperately."
"10849","centrally located within walkingdistance to the museumarea "
"10850","ordered a room in the back of the hotel - not facing the street - but got a room on second floor facing the street (with streetcars, trams, buses, cars etc. really  terribly noisy) beds too softy, pillows impossibly thick and high, stuffed with some rubbermaterial, room very, very small, bathroom just a shower and toilet - and if you are a bit oversized  (which I am not thankfully) I do not know how you would be able to get in there in the first place."
"10851","There is an excellent advantage of this hotel is location. The strategic location let us wandering around from east yo west without worry about transport."
"10852","The room is not expected big, the photo really for illustration only. The deluxe room not much different than superior room. But the price is different. Some rate the hotel 3stars, some rate the hotel 2star. The toiletries is not complete.  The floor is made of mable, but without disposable paper slippers. The floor is extremely cold. "
"10853","a little disappointed on arrival .hotel had no record of our booking and after a 5 hour flight .that's all we wanted at 1.30 in the morning.."
"10854","This hotel was previously the Ramada and our taxi driver from the airport was aware of this but others were not and had trouble finding it.....The room was excellent and the bathroom, although slightly dated was massive.  The beds were easily the most comfortable we have slept in on our travels."
"10855","Pool area could do with a clean up.... not well maintained or tables etc cleaned of dust.  Smoking in the restaurants put us off eating here."
"10856","Cannot praise the New Lanark Mill enough.....Everything about this place is fantastic.  The entire area is amazing.  We had a beautiful room overlooking the river.  The staff were all extremely friendly and accommodating.  Our meal in the restaurant was superb and breakfast was lovely.  "
"10857","The only negative about this hotel is that I can't visit more often.  We will definitely be back"
"10858","I have booked and paid the booking through Hotelopia. However, hotel receptionist Ainon refused to check me in as hotel is fully booked for the day. I have yet to get any refund from Hotelopia or Prescott. I feel cheated."
"10859","Very friendly and helpful straff. Room is clean and tidy every day. Excellent location 250 metres from the Vatican City. "
"10860","Clean, modern, located on the Malecon close to Habana Vieja. Very friendly, helpfull and smiling staff. Excelent food and breakfast."
"10861","Our third stay at this hotel and again did not disappoint.  Wish I could say the same for the weather."
"10862","from the moment you exit your vehicle staff are on hand to assist.  All staff were extremely efficient, friendly "
"10863","Rooms and bathrooms could do with some renovation as they are a little tired"
"10864","Fab views from the 12th floor.  Excellent shower.  Great location for the Bullring and station"
"10865","Swimming pool excellent."
"10866","The TV systems does not function well and over the period of stay it was not very useful especially when you have kids that want to enjoy this service.     The bath tub in the room discharge system did not function, one would expect that this would be check prior to check in. This resulted in us not being able to utilize the bath with the great scenery.    The housekeeping was not on par, papers were seen in the room behind objects which should have been removed prior to our check in.    Room provided to us was not correct as we were said that we would be upgraded to a Junior Suite, but we received the original room which was small and very uncomfortable for us as a family.    Management and staff was very helpful in trying to resolve the issues, but this should never have been issues in such a hotel which has a high level standing in the market place. This was a disappointing experience and one that I would like to forget."
"10867","Very nice room and absolutely gorgeous grounds. The breakfast spread was very nice and catered for a wide variety (no cooked options though).  The internet in the room worked very well."
"10868","Location is the biggest downside, as it requires going outside of the main part of Siena, near the railway station and up some darkish/quiet back streets (not bad while the supermarket is open, but very quiet after 10pm) - so less good for walking, but totally fine with a car. The British part of me would also have liked some milk in the room for tea, but it wouldn't be too hard to get it from the supermarket (about 5-10 minutes walk away)."
"10869","The eveing entertainment was too close to oneanothe, if you sat outside you could here both lots of music"
"10870","location,facilities etc very good"
"10871","room allocated to us was above the hammam .The music "
"10872","Amazing location"
"10873","They must improve breakfast as it the same thing everyday."
"10874","Very friendly helpful staff. Exceptionally clean hotel, the rooms are cleaned every day and towels changed. Excellent position in Fira close to main square, bus station restaurants etc. but not too close for it not to be relaxing."
"10875","At night the doors banging due to the  they are made, this can't be helped but it kept waking us up and early morning staff up and down stairs to roof outside our balcony. The breakfast - plenty to eat but the same every day it needs to be changed because if you are there for a week there is no choice. "
"10876","Very clean and well kept hotel."
"10877","The hotel looks amazing, the food is good and the drinks are all good brands (Becks,Pepsi etc..."
"10878","This hotel has the potential to be outstanding however the are some issues that need to be sorted out first. The system for booking the a la carte restaurants is an absolute joke! You need to get up at 07:30 am to stand in a que and book Your dinner on the touchscreen computer in the main lobby, only to find that all tables are fully booked for the next 2 days. This system just repeats itself and makes your holiday a stressful rush to get to that machine (what happened to relaxing)  I was asking for a glass of merlot red wine and the waiter did not know what it was, you would think in a 5 star a la carte restaurant they would know what wines they have.   "
"10879","The Hotel is Clean and all  the staff members are professionals and the quality of the food are Good.....Thanx Cape Town Ritz Hotel i will call again..."
"10880","Excellent apartments in a great location. Staff and owners cannot do enough for you and are always available to advise if the need arises. Apartments are spotless, food is great thanks to Ali the chef and the bar staff are on the ball!!!!"
"10881","Good position for our visit to London."
"10882","A great place to stay everything on your doorstep "
"10883","Very clean beautiful location"
"10884","Our room was fantastic although a covered balcony would have been preferable. The weather was bad and we couldnt even sit out on the balcony because the rain comes through he wooden covering."
"10885","The food for a 5 star hotel was not good. I first of all do not like to help myself at the buffet, i much prefer to order from a menu. After we had eaten a little bit of the food on offer we asked for tia maria coffee, but were told you dont have tia maria. I really expected more. On sunday morning we went to breakfast and walked in on a staff briefing. Shouldnt that be done away from the guests or earlier. Not a good experience all round and certainly wont return."
"10886","No positive things about this hotel "
"10887","Room dirty, staff not polite and helpful, food always the same, this hotel is very bad and i think you have to take out this hotel offer from your website!! And just a remark to customer service department . One of your employee  esther, is not very helpful and not polite!!! I was very disappointed from this hotel and disgusted"
"10888","Beautiful hotel, immaculate rooms, lovely staff"
"10889","Breakfast buffet - foods not replenished very often. Ran out of bacon and other hot foods. Hard to get a refill of Tea or Coffee"
"10890","Direct connect to the airport so very good location if you want to stay only one night in HK for transfer."
"10891"," It was in a great location and the staff were great. Food was okay for the price."
"10892","We booked through Hoteltopia picture of the room on the site did not match the room as the room was outdated and terrible. Advertised a gym which was not there also Wi FI not to every room as stated. It is not great for a family and we will not stay there again but it is a cheap hotel and you for what you get."
"10893","Hotel room was clean for hotel of this price range. Staff were friendly and helpful generally. Despite problems still good value for money  The down to earth Indian/Pakistani dishes in the resaurant were realy good but the european stufff like omlettes, croisants etc were well below standard."
"10894","Apartment had no fridge, when I complained we were given fridge which froze everything. Two electric sockets were faulty, these were replaced. Wash basin tap was loose, this was still a bit loose after being ""fixed"". Telephone was faulty and the button were elegible, this was replaced. While one realises faults happen in rooms, this room seemed to be neglected either by hotel maganement or previous occupants not reporting faults.   There is bulding going on accross the street from the hotel, this meant noise distruption at most hours of the day. The nature of the rooms window meant the noise was not contained by the windows.  Had to ask for room to be cleaned, which it was after our daily request. Had to request two sets of towels for two people, which I feel one shouldnt have to.  Waiting staff in reastaurant were hit and miss in there ability to understand english.  "
"10895","Hotel personal is very rude, and promises made are not done."

"10912","Great location, next to NEC and Airport, just off motorway. Restaurant was very good, staff on reception, bar and restaurant were all very polite, helpful and welcoming"
"10913","Spa changing room needs some attention, lighting failed when we were there. Showers area and wash basins were untidy with waste, and no shower soaps which might have been useful. Pool was good, and the steam room, just needs to get the changing area sorted."
"10914","Very good location, 5 minute walk to where the high speed boat docks. Outside terrace for breakfast was lovely, view of Hvar harbour, food selection/quality fine. Hotel public areas and our room were clean and the bed was comfortable, also inc mini bar/ fridge, hair dryer, basic toiletries. Would definitely stay here again, based on the room rate we paid for our stay, in late Sept. Our room type was their basic city view, so small and at the back of the hotel, with no balcony, but this made it quiet and cool, these rooms are fine with just the ceiling fan to keep them cool, as the front of the hotel gets the sun and more noise."
"10915","Hotel could do with renovation, but no doubt this would double the room rates and although dated, room was very clean.The pool is small, but you can use the large pool, sun beds "
"10916","Great hotel in great surounding. The rooms are excellent with unbelieveble views. "
"10917","Great hotel near the cliffs.amazing room  "
"10918","Amoung the cheapest options that are not a hostel in London. "
"10919","Though cheap you do not get much space or value for the money. Old and boring hotel by looks. "
"10920","No gym facilities. We had room facing road and there was no window to open in room to allow fresh air in. "
"10921","Great pool area, 5 star accomodation"
"10922","Staining around vent on ceiling of lovely big room with balcony."
"10923","It was a much better experience tahn I would have expect. Espacially the buffet (diner and breakfast) is just amazing. Malayian cuisine at it's best! I can more than recommend this hotel if you have a layover!"
"10924","Superb location right next to sky train,  Soi Cowboy "
"10925","Once you know where hotel is, it's easy to get to but initially finding it wasn't easy as the BTS has several exits "
"10926","Very clean and modern. "
"10927","Nice, modern, comfortable rooms. Easy parking in the area. Did not use the bar but it looked nice."
"10928","The receptionist when we checked in was completely unprofessional. She ignored us for 15minutes when we arrived while speaking on the phone. Ok I get it she was busy, but usually the receptionist can smile or nod to acknowledge the guest. She just kept talking like we were invisible. Hurried and unprofessional check -in. I gave her my business card (I work in the industry and I know hotel usually use them for networking or just for their files) and she didn't know what to do with it. She looked at it and gave it back to me. I was speechless."
"10929","Tomatoes at breakfast smelled rotten, things were running out and the buffet looked crowded and unorganized. The waitresses at breakfast were wearing dirty uniforms. I get the fact that they work with food but I work in a hotel too and our team never looks like that.     On the arrival I asked for parking. The young guy at reception said 'sure,ok' and gave us the instructions on how to go to their underground parking. He never mentioned cost or any other procedure. At checkout we found out that we were charged 9 euro per night for the parking. The very polite (but with very bad English) female receptionist said she cannot cancel the charge. The price was not too much so I decided to pay and ask to see a supervisor just to log my complains. I was told that there is no supervisor available (!?!). Decided not to make a scene and left my business card asking for someone to contact me. I wanted to keep it small and just talk to someone, but I guess I need to make a big fuss for someone to get interested."
"10930","good location next to the beach "
"10931","good location, spacious interior, post-soviet aesthetic but still elegant, helpful staff, room ok."
"10932","great hotel close to the Old Town!"
"10933","Ideal location. Close to china town. "
"10934","Personal breakfast, good breakfast, nice pool, good food in restaurant, nice turn down service and good bath amenities."
"10935","Had to get used to open wall to the outside in bathroom - especially as mosquitos came in that . Beach-area not very nice."
"10936","When I was still in the sweet dream, I was shouted that the door bell was rang in the morning, when I opened the door, the supervisor told me he just want to supervise/check the room. Oops, my god, what a sth reason ya... I really really don't like that unreasonable service during my stay..."
"10937","Excellent hotel. Great rooms. Great service. A movie was being filmed at time of stay which made the stay more enjoyable. "
"10938","Wonderful setting and ambience. Well situated."
"10939","Staff interactions were rather mechanical. We got the impression we were tolerated rather than welcomed. Rooms were cleaned very late in day after we'd returned from activities."
"10940","Very central, staff excellent, wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
"10941","No lift, room 40 would be the best room if you can request it."
"10942","Nice,small hotel.  The furnitures aren't up to date,but everything was clean. Very friendly and helpfull staff. The famous Waikiki beach is just a 5 minutes walk away."
"10943","The walls aren't very thick,so sometimes we heard the tv or voices of our neighbours and the vakuum cleaner in the corridor starting every morning at 8 am."
"10944","This is my 4th visit to the hotel, which I think says something. The staff are friendly and helpful at all times. The hotel is magnificently located right on the beach just outside Marbella, with a bus ride of 10mins into the centre, which gives you the best of both worlds; quiet, relaxation and shopping and night life."
"10945","I was a little disappointed with the restaurant this visit. Although the quality of the food is very good, the variation was lacking. I really don't want to eat pork for another year! I realise all tastes have to be catered for but personally I would like to see some dishes of the region now and again."
"10946","This hotel is in a very central location, it has a good sized swimming pool the staff are friendly."
"10947","I feel this hotel can do with a bit of paint it seems very dated. I also feel this hotel is aimed at the younger market with its central location to the Veronica's area. I also would recommend hat they look at there drinks policy they state that you are only aloud 2 drinks per person from the bar at any time. However if they are some larger groups of young one they can get up to. 20 drinks provided on trays. This then means that if you are standing at the bar in the que you can be waiting some time to be served in a bar with one member of staff and with no air conditioning! "
"10948","Clean specious rooms nice bathroom with high pressure hot water. Large and clean swimming pools, friendly and helpful staff."
"10949","Same variety of food everyday nothing exciting, room service skipped a few days (2 cleaning in 5 days) there are very little pool/poolside activity during the day almost no animations/attractions. This hotel has no beach yes it is on seaside but there are no sandy beaches to walk on or have your child to play with sand. This hotel is very good if you are coming from Russia or eastern Europe as 80% of customers are from there. I would not stay there again for this money  "
"10950","Lovely two bed, two bath room, very spacious, looking north was pretty. In same street and therefore very close to restaurants.  Great hotel."
"10951","We were on tenth floor and facing north so the noise of the Telstra building's airconditoning made the outside balcony sitting noisy and not relaxing.  It's a shame that tiny ants were in kitchen, although it didn't worry us as we didn't cook any food.  "
"10952","nice staff, large rooms plenty of facilities, vicinity to the beach, peace n quiet as not in the centre, 10 min on the bus to the marbella centre"
"10953","some facilities crowded, dated decor"
"10954","Smooth check in, only had to wait a couple of minutes.  Offered a room on the 22nd floor of Tower 1 with a great city view.  Rooms very spacious with flat screen TV and tea/coffee facilities.  Staff were extremely pleasant.  Yes, it's a big hotel and the lobby can be very busy, but I still felt that I was treated as a guest and not just a number.  Location is great for the BART (for SF airport) and all MUNI transport (buses and cable cars).  The area around the hotel felt fine, although there are a lot of beggars which may make some people uncomfortable - however, we found that wherever we went in downtown SF or Fisherman's Wharf - it's not limited just to the Hilton by any means. I would definitely stay at the Hilton again if I am in SF on a future holiday."
"10955","Only had food/snacks from the Starbucks in the Lobby as the breakfast and dinner menus were more expensive than eating out.  Starbucks was slightly more expensive than regular Starbucks, one of which was just one block away.  Other than that, nothing but a positive experience."
"10956","The room was small but adequate, staff were helpful"
"10957","The meals were overpriced and the menu didn't describe adequately the ingredients in dishes, coriander in abundance in a chicken dish. Renovations were going on at the time of our visit so I'm assuming when finished will make a big difference to reception area etc"
"10958","A bit tired could do with some renovation, and not enough staff in bar area"
"10959","we have had many happy holidays staying here at the tuntas apartments,rooms are cleaned dairy and the staff are so friendly,they help you no matter what you ask of them,good size rooms,we shall look forward to staying there again next year "
"10960","Overrated. Not as good as expected. Room not made up until after 4.00 p.m.! Clearly understaffed.  Very expensive WiFi which is included in similar hotels of this category. Charging $12 per appliance per day is outrageous (my wife and I have a smartphone each and I also use a laptop). Fortunately I was ultimately able to persuade the hotel to waive the fee, but this should not be necessary. Loews should understand that WiFi is standard these days, like electricity in the rooms and water in the bathrooms!"
"10961","The hotel was great! The staff were very friendly. The hotel is in a fantastic location only a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower! It was so good in fact that we are planning on staying there again next year!"
"10962","inexpensive option in Doha with buffet breakfast served on time"
"10963","Had a wonderful time as did my dog Macey.  The staff was professional and kind, particularly the Amanda and they young guy in the morning who helped me find a great hike.  The espresso machine was such a great perk...literally. I borrowed one of the bikes and had fun although next time I would bring my own mountain bike.  I would stay there again and will and have recommended Summit to friends. Job well done : )"
"10964","There was some construction out front and I asked the afternoon front desk person if it would be possible to change rooms since I did not want to be woken up by construction noise, she said no.  The following morning I brought it up to Amanda, she said she would see what she could do and changed my room almost immediately."
"10965","Excellent customer service would highly recommend to anyone wanting to stay."
"10966","just that the Fish my husband had was slightly overcooked, but everything else was perfect.  "
"10967"," Your room offered no crockery, cutlery ,not even a cork screw (to open a bottle of wine) As we had stayed in a nearby   motel with the above, plus free pink line trolly travel plus a booklet of vouchers for events "
"10968","The staff is very helpful and delivered promise.  I am glad that the extra bed is already in the room after we checked in  I am impressed with the freebies in the room"
"10969","The pool is not well maintained"
"10970","           Staff Professionalism"
"10971","Situated near touristy things and shopping. Good value for money. "
"10972","Could have been more tolerant of kids. Pool could be a bit warmer. "
"10973","Situation and swimming pool"
"10974","Poor breakfast and old room"
"10975","Nice houses, lots of Sunny spaces you can sit. Nice pool.Housekeeping ladies are really nice and work hard.If you need something, they do it in no time"
"10976"," The reception really needs to follow lessons in how to treat guests.  If you arrive, or if you go : they dont ask you if you had a good trip, dont thank you or wish you a good trip back home. "
"10977","the television could have worked better, very slow.   "
"10978","Bathroom good use of space"
"10979","I would have slept better if all the water did not have to be extruded adjacent to my room. Room typically tiny  "
"10980","The hotel is only about 6 years old and so the quality of the decoration and maintenance is high. The facilities are well thought out with good access, though there are many steps to the lower sunbathing and beach areas. The hotel do provide a continuous  shuttle service back to the main pool area for those who don't fancy the climb. The main dining room is spacious with loads of choice and young children are well catered for with their own buffet and dining area.  There are four themed restaurants which are available for guests on all inclusive and staying at least seven nights. These make a nice change from the main buffet, as they are waiter served - the Turkish was superb, the seafood very good, with the Chinese and Italian OK. The rooms are of a good size, though a little too ""beige"". The free safe, and free soft drinks in the mini bar are a nice touch. Food is always available, and not just pizza and chips - the patisserie in the main building  and the pancakes by the beach provided a nice change. Service was good and always friendly. "
"10981","The nearest place to stay for people who wants to go to Istana Negara specifically for medal conferment. Nice surroundings and affordable studio suites."
"10982","The room was nice, clean and comfortable. The dinner and breakfast was really good with rich buffet and very nice food. There was also a zebra in the garden, so wonderful. "
"10983","Good customer service, 24 hours reception. "
"10984","Gym equipment is old and can injure someone.  Photocopies of photocopies of room facilities list give a bad impression. Same for handwritten Wi-Fi notes on room documents. They can just print something nice at minimum cost."
"10985","very big room and great cleaning service (we were staying in deluxe room) and good greek meals with variety of food (we have all inclusive option), no problem with sunbeds arronud pools. "
"10986","Hotel doesn't have own beach - distance is not to far but it is not a place to spend a nice day.   Location of the hotel - there is nothing arround."
"10987","Very well situated across from the railway station and the main transport hub for buses and trams, the lake is less than 10 minutes walk away The staff are pleasant and friendly and spoke good english  "
"10988","location, excellent breakfast for price.Large rooms"
"10989","It is within 500metres of the Deira Shopping Centre with the metro included in the complex, despite the hotel staff saying it is very far.  It is also very close to the airport although you do have to contend with the constant traffic."
"10990","The room we stayed in had a dreadful drain smell which didn't appear until the day after we had checked in.  It didn't appear to be coming from the bathroom but may have been coming through the air-conditioning system.  The bathroom is very nice but the drain in the shower should be larger to contend with the water as it ends up on the outside of the shower and soaks the bathmat."
"10991","Good atmosphere, excellent service, good breakfast, comfortable towels that can also be used at the poolside."
"10992","Streetnoise. Dinnermenu limited choice of dishes. "
"10993","Basic, clean and good value for money. Very convenient for motorway which is ideal if you are just needing a stopover on a long, journey. Secure parking was very welcome. Good hot showers."
"10994","The shower  base did not adequately contain the water so the water escaped  the rest of the cubicle"
"10995","position of hotel is good, nice breakfast , clean environment  staff is helpful  room is bright enough"
"10996","a little bit expensive of a 4 stars hotel, small swimming pool  the jacuzzi is bad  Poor wifi connection  "
"10997","The chic look/style and modern facilities (such as the bathroom with walk-in shower, the flatscreen TV and very efficient air conditioning) of Hostal Domus are excellent for accommodation of this rating and make it great value for money. It isn't in central Malaga, but the bus is cheap enough to take as many times as you need in a day - plus, you can walk along the seaside path all the  into town in 30 minutes or less. The breakfast included is simple (coffee, juice and toast/croissant), but it's made freshly for you and brought out to you on the terrace."
"10998","I landed in Malaga feeling hideous after a 5am start and arrived at the hotel just after 11am but was told check-in was not possible before the  official time of 2pm - I guess this may have been because there only appeared to be one member of staff on duty, but I was a little shocked that there was no flexibility to even come back in an hour or so. I've never previously come across accommodation that enforced the check-in time so strictly."
"10999","Staff were lovely - music by the pool fantastic.  Beds very comfortable."
"11000","Two towels are not enough per room per day - an extra towel would have been good.  The milk containers in restaurant for breakfast were never quite clean where the handle and spout join inside.  Pork Bacon would have been nice also."
"11001","The locality next to the river. "
"11002","Thr receptionist was as unfriendly and unco-operative as you can get. The room we were allocated had a non working air conditioner. We were subsequently moved to a room with more faults. Dinner was awful and breakfast was terrible. This was the worst hotel I've ever slept in.  "
"11003","A true 5 star Luxury hotel, The Residence Mauritius lives up to its reputation. The hotel itself is stunning, with glorious décor and beautiful rooms and suites. A butler assigned to each room is always available to assist the hotel’s residents. The staff are friendly, courteous and always available when needed. The hotel’s pools and beachside area are comfortable and clean, and its spa includes many services, a beautiful gym, sauna and steam room.  The dining is amazing with theme nights, a la carte meals and buffets that include a wide variety of appetizers, meals and desserts. Live entertainment is available every night with a band and singers, and some nights include Sega dancing and music, the major genre of Mauritius sung in creole. The Residence Mauritius has our vote. "
"11004","very good situation of the hotel (opposite to Koutoubia mosque and next to Medina and Place Djemaa-el-Fna)  cooperative staff at the reception (change of the room and storage of the luggage without any problems)"
"11005","We felt the hotel was at most a 2 * star rating and the facilities provided  Met this rating. "
"11006","The hotel is in serious need of a kick of paint looks very tired and warn outside.  The dining staff had trouble managing the number of guests when we stayed our plates were snatched away as soon as we finished eating and we were hurried so they could get the table ready for more guests.  The picture advertising the hotel is deceptive"
"11007","Well designed and very comfortable rooms"
"11008","The decoration of this hotel is modern which I like very much. The room is clean, and the bed is comfortable.  This hotel sit at the center of Helsinki, just away from the central Railway station by 5 mins walking distance. So many shopping mall and shops gathered around the hotel, making it convenient for travelers !  The staffs are nice, very helpful."
"11009","Only one negative comment is about the breakfast : not so much food for choice."
"11010","Clean, friendly, beautiful setting,"
"11011","Not enough staff around to assist with baggage, no mini barset up! bar prices expensive "
"11012","Great location, very handy for the tube."
"11013","Room number 4 is right next to the kitchen, so don't expect to sleep after 6.30am"
"11014","Friendly and helpful staff. Nice, clean rooms every day  "
"11015","Poor hotwater during peak hours during our stay at 5th floor. We were told top floors could have this problem.  "
"11016","Perfect location next to Little Italy and a 5min walk from the bay front. Large size room, quick internet and a great selection from the buffet breakfast. Also all the staff were very friendly and attentive."
"11017","It is next to the Trolley stop for Little Italy which run every 20mins from 04:00ish until 23:30 so expect to hear the clanging and bells of the barriers. It is bearable unless you are a very light sleeper."
"11018","Very modern, clean and value for money.  Good gym with new equipment"
"11019","Spacious rooms with fridge. Lovely pool area."
"11020","Tired looking rooms.  Lifts barely working.  Maids were often late to clean.  Noisy air con units."
"11021","We chose this Hotel for its location and was not disappointed it was lovely   The staff are very nice plenty of good food very clean and peaceful at night  It was nice that you couldn't hear anything from the room next door   We didnt want to leave and will defiantly stay at the Simbad again "
"11022","Plenty of sunbeds around pool but a little uncomfortable   As they had no cushion on them so very hard to stay on   Them for too long a waterproof cushion would have been   Perfect "
"11023","Great position."
"11024","ordered room service breakfast and never got it. was very upset."
"11025","Nice and simple help on the reception. You can check in 24 hours. Take your sheets whit you and no extra cost. Lockers downstairs for small money to store your valuables. Also small lockers for free but you need your one lock so bring it ore buy it for 60 CR"
"11026","I was in a 8 person room. Even when everyone sleeps at 12 o clock at night new people came in! There is a small kitchen in the room. It was no problem for this night because there were nice people,  but suppose some one make fish ore cook dead animals, what terrible it is to sleep then!   Also it is mixed man and women. (but maybe this is positive for some...)"
"11027","Nice room with good layout and functions. Comfortable beds"
"11028","Restaurant food could be better.  Menu choice poor and price high.  "
"11029","Rooms with paper thin walls and drunken revellers crashing through the toilet into the bed,  while tour residents return from the town to continue their all night vigil on the froint steps  of the hotel, not the sort of entertainment one had hoped for at 4 am. Can't even occupy the  mind with the internet because the hotel does'nt pay more than the bottom service rung and  uses the bad service to steer everyone with a pc towards the internet-pay-desk.....wifi for  Apple worked after a fashion. At 27 squids per night there had to be a catch."
"11030","Clean,great facilities- pools are superb. Breakfast room's location, a great  to start the day.  Very relaxing."
"11031","None except they provide you four walls, constantly disturbed by the passing train as the hotel lies next to the railway station."
"11032","Clean facilities and friendly staff"
"11033","Check out is too early! "
"11034","Very nice place for relax. The hotel has 3 buildings: Club, Gant and Castle, also cottages and villas are available. Every building has own style for different choice. We got a room in Club hotel - for us it was the best variant, as SPA zone and main restaurant are located in same building. All rooms and hotel looks quite new. Our room was in classical scandinavian design.   There are several restaurants and bars. We arrived quite late and try to find place for dinner (about 23:00). Bar O'learys was open, but we would like to sit in some traditional restaurant. The guys from O'learys bar helped us to find table in Le Biff restaurant - bit thanks them for that! We ordered special menu package and that was great! Especially dessets :)  Breakfast in main restaurant was well. Good choice of meal (hot and cold dishes, fruits, muesli, jogurts, special kid's table, etc.). All meal was fresh and waiters supported all assortment during all breakfast.   The main bonus with booking via Hotelopia is free use of waterpark in other case it's quite expensive (20 EUR for 2,5 hours for each guest).  Thanks a lot to Hotelopia and all hotel's staff for our pleasant stay and short relax break.     "
"11035","Nothing negative, just can advice some improvements:  Could be nice to have more towels and cosmetics in room (in our room was only 2 towels for everybody and shower gel, nothing else).  Please, put water and some drinks in mini-bar (our mini bar was totally empty, but after SPA water is necessary)  Sauna World open 12-21 which is not comfortable for guests who stay 1 night.     "
"11036","Bed was very comfortable and location was very good"
"11037","We were unable to access any WiFi at this hotel. The kitchen consisted of only a microwave, sink and a fridge in a small cupboard. Not enough for an apartment relying on self-catering. Reception was understaffed, and the staff that were there seemed unable to cope with the most basic of requests, eg ordering a taxi."
"11038","very nice and clean hotel. It was near Victoria Station and the room and beds were very good.  "
"11039","Small room and toilet. But it was a good price so I understand that the room could not be bigger."
"11040","The hotel is in a good location minutes away from La Rambla"
"11041","The hotel rooms are very small, we were unable to get to the bed with the stroller due to the small passage  that leads to the bed which in addition was blocked with furniture.    The rooms offered no facilities, wi-fi was not free and despite paying did not offer enough coverage for the room I had to stay in the lobby to browse, there was no minibar (although the cupboard where it should have been was happily blocking the passageway).    I cannot offer an opinion with regards to the food because I did not eat there."
"11042","well located in a quiet position on the Riverwalk"
"11043","The location of the hotel was excellent.  The hotel itself was nice and the staff were friendly and competent."
"11044","I was misinformed about the location of our pickup bus and the staff on duty seemed to find this amusing.  Since I wasted an hour looking for the non-existent cafe I did not share their view."
"11045","Noise from the street in the night and in the morning"
"11046","Room a bit noisey. Towels poor quality, only left one per person but we requested more and we got them. Breakfast finished at 9.30..a bit too early. Check out at 11am also a bit early.."
"11047","Friendly no fuss staff, just how I like it. Nice sized room and very comfy beds."
"11048","We were on the 4thbfloor and in the morning you can here people having breakfast on the 5th floor above us, specifically scraping their chairs and dropping cutlery."
"11049","inspite of being a little bit far from the center of the city,we enjoyed very much in our stay there.the staff were polite and helpful.food was good.the room end facilities were excellent"
"11050","I walked in to this hotel with a low expectation. How wrong was I. It was great from start to finished. We were shown on a map our exact location. We were told of things to see and do. We then were given a welcome drink. Nothing was any trouble.  The staff were the friendliest staff during my 1week visit to italy and surrounding islands. On the day we were to leave we were given a lift by the manager. We were also given a snack and to top it off he give us his own umberella to keep with us on our onward journey as the rain was so heavy. Amazing. I would recommend.  For such a low price we had amazing 5star treatment."
"11051","ideal locationfor Wembly Arena and stadium.  Bed very comfortable."
"11052","  Staff were very helpful, recommending a great restaurant in town, the Dioscuri, which overlooked a picturesque little harbor.  Hotel location was private and quiet when we were there in late September.    Very good view from the balcony of the long beach stetching back towards Kardamyli and the lush mountains along the rugged coast to the south.    The best thing for us, however, was how quickly and professionally the hotel owner, Mrs. Zoubaki, sent our forgotten passports to our hotel in Athens, so we could make our flight back to the States on time.  We are very grateful to her for that!    This comment doesn't reflect either a positive or negative tone because we weren't planning to swim at the hotel's beach, but it may be worthy of note.   We were surprised that the ""beach"" of Cardimili Beach Hotel was, in fact, interesting, although very sharp, limestone formations instead of sand.  There is is a wooden walkway, however, that extends from a small sandy area where beach chairs are placed out across the limestone to stairs that access the water.   "
"11053","Arriving in Kardamyli in the evening, it was difficult to see the sign, or at least we missed seeing the sign, for the road out to the hotel, which I thought would be closer into town than it actually was (about two kilometers), so we missed the turn a couple of times before we found it.    The evening we were there, our room's air condtioner was irregular during the night, and the water in the shower was only lukewarm.                                 "
"11054","The breakfast buffet was fabulous.   The staff were kind and helpful!   Location is great, very close to the MTR, convenient shops and great restaurants. "
"11055","Very hard beds.   Rooms need updating, especially bathroom.   No hairdryer abailable.   No dressing gowns. "
"11056","We love staying here ( this is our third time) because it is a small hotel so everything feels so personal.  Staff are excellent !!!!!!"
"11057","Although food was OK we felt it was not as good as previous stays - as far as selection etc.  Many things repeated every night just in a different form. Eg grilled fish on Monday crumbed fish on Tuesday and then fish in sauce on wednesday"
"11058","Difficult to find by car even with an GPS. Had a taxi  in front to show us where the hotel was located. No streetnumber and any kind of signs at entrance which is in a kind of industrial area. Bad variety of food at breakfast and no coffeemachines working. It's not an expensive hotel, but can't recommend it."
"11059","We had  made reservations for 2 rooms only showed up as one. I don't think that was their fault i think that was Hotelopia.  There was a leak in the ceiling in the bathroom. The carpets were wavy and falling apart. The hotel need major renovations.Vending machins were either out of order or not stocked we had to outside to a convenience store to buy water."
"11060","Checkin. Longtime and not good"
"11061","I can  recommend this hotel to anyone.  This is a very good hotel and the location is perfect.  The only thing I would prefer otherwise is to have better speed on the free internet (Wifi)."
"11062","Nothing negative"
"11063","Very nice spacious room.  good value for the money."
"11064","Elevator from carpark does not serve the rooms on the 1st floor resulting in having to carry the luggage through stairs."
"11065","Nice place to stay. I didn't eat there so can't comment on food"
"11066","Fantastic hotel, clean,great location and very friendly staff ,it is a firm favourite of ours this was the 3rd time we have stayed there "
"11067","Close to the city and the beach"
"11068","Not very guestfrendly when we first arived, since we were so young, told ua that it was not a party hotel. We was not at a party trip either. On 4 persons we only recivde 1 keycard..."
"11069","Nice boutique hotel close to the centre of Edinburgh. Small but staff friendly and room clean."
"11070","The room was small, however was a single. The handle on the inside of the shower was broken which meant I couldn't shut it properly. Fairly noisy with coming and goings and doors slamming. Also when I checked out they had no record of payment through hotelopia, yet the transaction was on my credit card statement. I had to call credit card company who then had to speak to the hotel. Perhaps thus is something hotelopia should review as it was rather embarrassing. "
"11071","Excellent friendly service. Nice comfy room with lovely large white fluffy bath towels. Cannot fault  our stay."
"11072","Carlos and his staff were all brilliant and made our stay a good one.  We had breakfast in the hotel every morning and we were served quickly  The hot tub on the roof is excellent and good value 5 euros each for 30 mins the area on the roof is clean and relaxing.  the room was basic but cleaned every day to a high standard clean towels were left every day . t.v in room tuned in to English channels so we could catch up with news back home . will re.visit soon"
"11073","building project going on across the street but not to much of a bother."
"11074","Firstly, the location couldn't have been better. There were U and S Bahn stops within easy walking distance, a street-tram stop right at the end of the street, and even a bus right in front of the hostel. The whole neighborhood was full of cafes, restaurants, and bars. We were walking distance from the East Side gallery and other neat things too!    The staff were friendly, helpful, and very nice. They were also profficiently bilingual. My mother felt comfortable asking them about the neighborhood even though she doesn't speak a word of German.     We booked a double room with en suite bathroom. The room was pretty much exactly what was promised on the website. The beds were more than long enough for someone six feet tall, the blankets were warm and comfortable, and the sheets were crisp and freshly laundered. It wasn't luxury, but that also wasn't promised.     Housekeeping emptied the wastebasket while we were out, too.     If you are on a budget and looking for somewhere clean and safe in a good location, this is a great place to book. "
"11075","I was not prepared that our two beds would be bunk beds. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time.     Also, even though the bathroom was sparkling clean, there was a crack in the grout at the wall of the shower, so the shower leaked  the floor. The staff was kind enough to give me an extra towel to put on the floor, but that needs to be taken care of.    Don't bother with the breakfast. It isn't anything special, and there are so many adorable cafes in the neighborhood where you can get something much better for the same price. "
"11076","perfect location. easy to go everywhere in hing kong.   "
"11077","Arrived at hotel at 11.30, I checked with reception what the checking in time was, and I was told it was from 2.00, we left the car in the car park and went into harrogate for lunch.   We returned to the hotel at 2.10 to be confronted with a chaotic scene, there was a large queue of people at reception who were clearly angry. When we eventually got to the front of the queue we were informed that our room was not ready due to a "" large checkout that morning"" we informed the staff on the desk that we were meeting friends for a party at 4.00 and we needed to get in the room to shower and change. We were told to wait in the bar and come back again in 20 minutes.   The 2nd attempt we made to check in was even more chaotic, this time the queue was larger and for some reason only 2 staff were on the desk, an elderly couple in front of us had come from a wedding, they had hoped to check into their room and return to the wedding, after 20 minutes of waiting they gave up, as there were no staff about I had to help them with their luggage back to the car.   Eventually after 2 hours we got to our room, which was very disappointing, dated with a poor bathroom and furniture.  When we checked out the following day we were again met with a large queue, the staff were abrupt and did not ask if we had enjoyed our stay  Will not be going back"
"11078","No mention on voucher that is was 500m trek to collect keys, if it was raining or you had lots of bags and children this would have been a major issue.  Other small comment is noise late at night from other apartments. "
"11079","We ended up paying twice for afternoon tea this was not spotted until we pointed this out. The bedroom walls are quite thin could hear conversation in the next room."
"11080","  Very attentive and friendly staff, very important to me,as i'm on my own!  Stylish room decor.  Fantastic location, inspiring hotel foyer."
"11081","  Noisy, my room was above the kitchen exit, and I was woken at 5.30 a.m, with things being delivered, this racket continued for over half an hour. The first morning I was woken at 7.15 a.m by a maintenance man, calling me, telling me how to use my remote, to get TV working, as when I checked in the evening before, there was no signal.Very thoughtless, as I had a big celebration the evening before!  There was a lot of noise when the housekeeping staff emptied bottles ect from when cleaning rooms. Very tight fit in bathroom, sliding door would have been more appropriate!"
"11082","Public transportation, nice restaurants, bars and a Carrefour Express very nearby."
"11083","If you have a appt. on the street side of this hotel, know that you will not be able to sleep quiet with your window open, because of all transportation noise and noise from the restaurant underneith this appt. hotel. Furthermore the rooms are run down, not very clean and you get a very poor breakfast. The front office staff can only speak Spanish. You will get your keycard of the appt. and no further information of the whereabouts."
"11084","The cheeky £5 parking charge was a bit of a surprise."
"11085","Hotel very clean and nice decor.   Hotel reception staff friendly especially filip ! Staff at reception helped us and found out info for us .  Pool and sauna clean indoor pool warm . Went out of season so not many kids.  Nice well equipped gym.near to sea and lots of space for loungers.   Lots of food plenty of fruit. Outdoor pool looked nice but didn't try.   Bed was comfortable and sheets looked white and clean.  Room was in block c and trees limited view of sea.  But room was a nice size shower was ok .      "
"11086","The list is extensive and it would involve me reliving my experience of staying there and I really don't wish to remember that hotel ever again. Simply awful"
"11087","On arrival we were met with a very pleasent reception staff member "
"11088","The room was ok, there were old very stained divan beds and an old ripped sofa, i found 3 pubic hairs on the carpet which was also old and worn. At breakfast the staff were nice enough but one member of staff was more interested in playing with his hair. The beans and tomatoes were very dried out and had clearly been under the hot plate a while, second morning at breakfast we were no approched at all, we had to find our own table and track down a member of staff for a pot of tea. The breakfast room was a mess with most tables dirty, and three staff members walking around with not a care in the world. I will not be back at this hotel "
"11089","The Britannia is a very dated hotel that needs a lot of work to modernize it. The Standard room we had was stuck in the 80`s complete with peeling wallpaper and a groaning, noisy Air conditioning system. It was clean however. Breakfast was a typical buffet selection but nothing out of the ordinary infact quite basic. Not sure on how it recieved a 4* billing"
"11090","Great staff,very friendly and helpful. Food was fabulous   I arrived with 4 children and 3 adults and we had a fantastic stay."
"11091","small  but comfortabble, safe"
"11092","indifferent to client,  "
"11093","It has a lot of activities which you can pay extra.  Great showers and helpful staff.  Beautiful white sweeping sand with a lovely setting.  Amazing dolphins which you get to feed for a few seconds.  I can imagine that families would love going to this place."
"11094","The eating area is a collection of add ons over many years.  Unfortunately it looks like they are adding more  the various extensions  instead of knocking it down.   They were renovating the eating area during school holidays so a bit of hammering etc... going on. The breakfast room was a very outdated, mishmash of rooms with a servery at one end.  There are several supporting poles which can get in the  of making a lap around the servery.  I had to ask for new bread as the loaf of bread had mould on it.  The second loaf of bread had mould on it too!! Mmmmm.....  I thought $300 a night  too steep for outdated accommodation.  Ive stayed in better for a lot less!!"
"11095","Great location "
"11096","Very nice stuff;   Sea view excellent  Located very centrally"
"11097","Air plains are very loud! Comments on booking.com, that the windows would be protective is not correct.  Pool on the roof very small.   Breakfast room to small. "
"11098","The staff were extremely professional, friendly and helpful.  The location is perfect. It is a beautiful old building."
"11099","The construction is old and the decor dated. "
"11100","Great reception from Louise, she made us feel very welcome, and was very helpful and a great member of the team "
"11101","The Noise from bathroom saniflow was a little uncomfortable just as well we knew each other very well?Also door did not close??"
"11102","1.most staff can speak English and understand.  2.attentive service rendered throughout our stay.  "
"11103","The shower. Somehow, it's still the old type used which makes bathing not so pleasant."
"11104","Good location and reasonable price"
"11105","TV picture was poor quality and there was no minibar (not a problem for me, but the website claims all rooms have it)"
"11106","The hotel is located one stop away from the ATL airport on the sky train to the rental car facility. This makes it easy to find and easy get to. It also allows travelers to stay in ATL without renting a car, as the MARTA transit system serves  the airport, i.e. one stop away. I highly recommend the hotel for travelers who are departing on an early flight from the ATL airport."
"11107","Quite expensive for below-average rooms. Mine had a very strong smell of humidity as I came in. TV didn't work, trash bin was broken, shower gel was finished, bed-furniture was full of stains and the room gave the overall impression as it had been left behind after being built probably in the 80s/90s. Not really worth the stay!"
"11108","Well we thought it was great, and fantastic value at the price we paid, we will be back!"
"11109","This was a genuine find.. The room was clean and recently refurbished. The bed was amazing - there was a usable desk in the room. The location was brilliant - the staff were wonderful."
"11110","They were taking advantage of the accommodation shortage on the weekend that I stayed to ramp up the room rate - but so was very hotel in town.. "
"11111","-  Friendly services, great pool, sufficient gym facilities,   -  Nice food, breakfast and diner buffet large selection and as Half Board reasonable priced   -  Reasonable priced, small but comfortable room  -  Location, next to Sharjah Airport  -  No local taxes, when booking through the right travel site  -  Sufficient close to Dubai"
"11112","Location, next to highway (noise), but not to be seen because of large trees"
"11113","Wonderful friendly helpfull staff, great location would recommend and return to stay again."
"11114","Bedroom decoration could do with updating"
"11115","Generous coffee and tea making facilities. Location close to food outlets."
"11116","Enterance steps a bit of a put off when arriving with luggage."
"11117","The apartment room is very spacious "
"11118","Poor accessibility was the the only poor comment about the hotel. We have to walk a long  in order to access to the hotel as it is located across a major road where crossing is merely impossible.  The hotel should also provide with free Wi-Fi services since its rated as 5 star."
"11119","The staff are very friendly. The hotel is in a very good location. I have stayed here several times now"
"11120","Check in 3 hours early was great after traveling in car 4hours. Pool was fantastic "
"11121","Excellent location, value for money, clean rooms, large toilet, comfortable bed"
"11122","Room size is too small, staff is somehow respond to request not that promptly"
"11123","Room was ok, location excellent."
"11124","The staff were not always friendly or helpful. However one of the waiters was excellent always very nice so was the head waiter. It would be helpful if it was made clear that you seat yourself at meal times, we were left standing at the restaurant doors not sure what the procedure was. It would be easier to have a member of staff greeting you and showing you to your seat and explain the dining arrangements. Some of the towels during the week had seen better days and need replaced. Expectation of a 4 star hotel would imply that sheets would be changed at least once during the week, sadly not changed once. Hotel was ok however not 4 star     "
"11125","Very pleased with the comfort and cleanliness.  The lack of a restaurant was a bit of a blow but your front desk staff produced a sheet of paper with all the local restaurants - from which we were able to make our choice.  "
"11126","None that I can recall!"
"11127","Very good location, friendly staff."
"11128","The best service and quality you can pay for ."
"11129","The breakfast need to be improve to match the quility that's you can have in other services. "
"11130","Shower over bath very badly placed and bath very slippery when wet. The hot breakfast wasn't "
"11131","Value for money and rooms were clean, perfect location, staff were excellent."
"11132","Great location on the beach, nice gardens, construction of new infinity pool almost completed, close to restaurants."
"11133","One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because it offered Kids Club as we were travelling with family including 5 young grandchildren.  Our understanding of Kids Club is that staff entertain children whilst parents take advantage of other hotel activities, i.e. spa, tennis, etc.   However, at this hotel, Kids Club means that parents accompany their children to a room and supervise them playing on such equipment.as might be found in a small playground.  Very disappointing!    Three other minor dissatisfactions  -  they charge a fee for ice, they charge for daily newspapers and they do not provide umbrellas for the occasional heavy rainfall."
"11134","good hotel close to everything  only  negative, not one drawer for clothes, live out of your suitcase"
"11135","excellent hotel, perfect central location, in a quiet side street, quiet being the important word. charming at reception, basic and clean.do not hesitate to stay here, and have everything on your doorstep."
"11136","Was surprised that they need deposit and accept cash only. There is no room service at all."
"11137","Scrambled eggs at breakfast not vety good, but this did not spoil the breakfast as there was lots of choice and so plenty of other options."
"11138","Location is brilliant, a little hard to find initially but once bearings are set its easy! "
"11139","Only certain rooms have wifi, staff are rude and unhelpful, rooms are ancient, facilities non existing. It is what it is. A cheap hotel in the middle of town. "
"11140","Not especialy.  I do not know quality of the food , because took nothing in this time."
"11141","very dusty tables ..lifts u have too wait a lot hell!!  long queues for breakfast -compact space to sit down "
"11142","Excellent in great location. "
"11143","Close to Chinatown."
"11144","Food is atrocious.  Restaurant staff are hopeless. Reception staff are professional."
"11145","I have stayed here several times because it is a good quality hotel located on a  beautiful beach. The rooms modern and well appointed and Armacao town is on the doorstep. Wifi in the lobby area but not in rooms unless you pay! Staff pleasant and helpful. "
"11146","Dining room breakfast is self-service which is fine. The cooked breakfast ingredients however are not good quality and are best avoided. The toasting machine, one of those roller affairs needs replacing as it takes 7 attempts to get any shade of brown. It's been like this for years and there are always queues of  puzzled faces.     We booked through Hotel Opia for the first time. When we arrived we were given probably the worst double room in the hotel; no balcony, etc etc and I suspect reserved for cheapskates like me! Fortunately we had booked a twin room so were able to ask for a move. Lucky us. We got a cracker just by the pool which was brilliant.     "
"11147","Extremely noisy. There is absolutely no insulation for sound whatsoever!"
"11148","Great hotel, and more importantly GREAT value for the money.  I got to Lisbon stayed somewhere else for two nights and was . I initially avoided this area of town because its far from the ""main drag"" but the metro there is VERY good. Plus this hotel is by a mall so at the very least if you need supplies its there. But the hotel is VERY nice. VERY clean and VERY quiet. Three things i always want. More importantly it was GREAT value for the money. We paid around 83 euros of it. But very happy about the place"
"11149","  Some stains in the carpet. Wi-Fi account is limited to 2 devices at a time (although it apparently is not enforced when we were there we had 4 devices on the account)    "
"11150","Martin was excellent and gave great service at the breakfast.  "
"11151","The hotel is cosy, but the room I had was very tiny and narrow. It was very loud from the traffic outside, and therefor problematic to sleep well through the night. "
"11152","Requested a Quiet room and got a very quiet room"
"11153","the rooms were very nice especially for the price"
"11154","the bar area was very busy and quite messy with dirty plates and glasses all over the place"
"11155","Couldn't vault this hotel - first class in every respect. Ignore any negative comments about noisy room or less than adequate breakfast- we had a room that was overlooking the Main Street on the 5th floor and the windows and shutters over them blocked out any street noise at night. In the morning when we opened them we were greeted by the sound of a man playing amazing classical music on a violin....really lovely. Breakfast was more than adequate and plentiful. It set us up well for our days of sight seeing. The room had a modern design with very comfy. This hotel far exceeded my expectations. "
"11156","Good location, friendly staff"
"11157","Excellent short stay hotel which was enhanced by the delightful staff both on the desk and the housekeeping staff.   Will definitely be returning"
"11158","Very nice service.Perfect location and very good service!"
"11159","Very pleasant and helpful staff, always serving with a great smile. Will make it a point to put you on my first choice of hotel on my future trips"
"11160","We have stayed at the Menzies Glasgow on a few occasions and have found it a good hotel. It is within walking distance to the SECC and Hydro. The city centre is only 5 minutes away.  The hotel has secure car parking just over the road at a current cost of £4.00 a day"
"11161","A couple of gripes this time around although the hotel was quite quiet we where offered a room next to the lift which turned out to be a disabled access room. We then upgraded to an apartment for another £20 per night and this was much better.  The breakfast is buffet style and adequate but having been going to the Menzies over the last few years there is a noticeable reduction in quality.   All in all I still have to say the Menzies represents good value for money."
"11162","easy to find,clean,staff on reception helpful.very good"
"11163","none,but I only stayed there Monday 7th to Tuesday 8th."
"11164","Great location and really friendly staff."
"11165","The hotel was spotless the staff were friendly and professional all our needs were catered for.      This is a quality hotel at its best"
"11166","Clean room with comfortable bedding.  food tastes good in the restaurant at reasonable price."
"11167","Enjoyable stay and friendly staff."
"11168","Fantastic hotel. Would return again no problem"
"11169","Nice and quiet at night and grounds were very clean. Fairly good location, about 10 minute walk to centre of Los Cristianos."
"11170","Towels in room only changed twice in 1 week. Maids didn't come in at all on 2 days."
"11171","Stayed for a night after watching the Speedway GP at Torun Motoarena, the hotel is well situated and the food was ace.  We were allowed to check in a couple of hours earlier than originally indicated and the staff were extra helpful in sorting this out.  "
"11172","The only reason I didn't give full marks was that the WiFi connection was somewhat intermittent however I suspect this was due to our room being the furthest from the centre of the hotel, it was a minor inconvenience at worst!"
"11173","Great location, easy to find, friendly reception staff, clean rooms, free WiFi."
"11174","Excellent variety of whiskey on offer. Good nostalgic atmosphere. "
"11175","Slightly shabby appearance, our room had mould all along the skirting board and crack in sink. Breakfast took ages to arrive."
"11176","All i can say, every things excellent and perfect!"
"11177","Everything excellent!"
"11178","Excellent experience, great breakfast, close to Sandton City and taxi services-ask for Patrick"
"11179","Excellent location and very helpful staff. It feels like being at home with a very friendly staff. Highly recommended."
"11180","Quite. I was able to sleep in a comfortable bed"
"11181","Shower too small  Breakfast was cold bread old slices non edible.   At reception strong smell of insect spray"
"11182","Close to the beach, nice hotel "
"11183","Only few tv programs, "
"11184","Average location but good value for money"
"11185","Breakfast could be better"
"11186","Stayed for 2 nights in 2012 and returned for a further 2 in 2013. Normally we like to stay in design hotels, but the location, pool, breakfast and amazing views brought us back again this year. The hotel is traditionally spanish in decor which is nice and the staff were very polite and helpful.  Because of the value for the money we will return here again for a couple of nights bed and breakfast without any hesitation."
"11187","Bedrooms need upgrading and the towels need replacing very soon."
"11188","Rooms are excellent, feel warm and welcome  Swimming pool is very good  Staff attentive  Hotel as a whole has character"
"11189","Music swimming pool too loud  Beds swimming pool far too old, not comfortably anymore  Attention must be paid to details: we had one day no towels, no waterstop in the bath so we could not take a bath, reception promised to give information but forgot, a.s.o.  "
"11190","Good location, upgraded us for one of the nights"
"11191","I stayed for 5 nights self catering. The complex is very secure with locked gates at every entrance. The apartment I stayed in was very spacious and open plan. Nice powerful hot shower. Also had a small kitchen with cooker, kettle, fridge/freezer and a small electric oven. The room also had a large 32"" TV with the main British channels. In a nice quiet location. A good 5-10 minute walk from the beach front and local shops. Very close to the main bus station in Las Americas. Ideal for someone/ couple looking for a nice quiet break. Couldn't fault a thing.  "
"11192","The only slightly negative thing I will say is the beds. They were not the most comfortable."
"11193","We had our room upgraded to a triple at no extra cost. The room was a good size with a wee balcony and air conditioning. Breakfast was included in the price and was an excellent selection, room was pretty good value for money. The hotel location was also really good. Close to the old town without being right in tourist central and close to the ferry and the new marina which was handy for us as we had just gotten off a yacht and planned to travel by ferry to another island"
"11194","There is a place for leaving your bags if you check out but are not travelling til later in the day, however, this is open and you don't have to go directly past reception to get to it. With so many people coming and going I would be surprised if the reception staff recognised all people staying there and it would likely enough to have things stolen.  We asked if there was a more secure place for our luggage. The receptionist agreed to store it in their office but she had her back up a bit when we said we didn't trust the standard place - my partner has had bags stolen from similar setups in the past"
"11195","Very useful for early flights"
"11196","Path to airport needs better lighting. We were followed by a man at 4.15 am and felt slightly nervous, although it turned out he was fine."
"11197","Fabulous location. Ample continental breakfast. Comfortable bedroom. Would definitely stay again. "
"11198","Great location for the Rock and Roll Marathon   I did not eat at the hotel"
"11199","Room and service of good quality with helpful staff."
"11200","Menu in the restaurant was very limited! The one fish dish was sold out and as I don't eat meat it was a hungry evening!"
"11201","Friendly and very helpful staff. Good location within walking distance of Praia da Rocha and Praia da Vau with beautiful sea views and stunning beaches."
"11202","The front desk staff is normally pretty shy and thus not very helpful, nevertheless, there are some outstanding assistant- and night managers The night manager who was in charge during my stay was outstandingly helpful and friendly, he helped me a lot when I lost my bank card in China."
"11203","friendly staff, great food, upgraded rooms, a very relaxing holiday"
"11204","Spacious clean apartment in a good position for beach and supermarkets. No shortage of Sun beds. Friendly staff value for money"
"11205","Be sure to check sheets and towels are changed as often as they are supposed to be.Noisy Irish guests "
"11206","Good accommodation and good variety of food of a good standard  We will be back"
"11207","We booked a room with private pool . The pool and patio area were always in the shade which was not ideal as we had gone to sunbathe ! The hotel did move us three days later when another room became  available  . Avoid room 234 if you want to sunbathe. "
"11208","Stunning beach, wonderful area and width of the property. Cool, modern look. A perfect holdiday destination. Can highly recommend!"
"11209","Very cool but almost too much. Not really a business hotel but would go back for a week end visit as location is good for leisure travel."
"11210","Big rooms, great pools, close to habour, shuttle is good, staff helpful"
"11211","Nothing really bad"
"11212","First time at the raddison, loved it.  Lovely room, lovely meal at college! Definately try again!"
"11213","Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice welcoming atmosphere. Superb value for money."
"11214","Too old, and without any wifi internet in the room, lifts are too danger to use"
"11215","Personnel very kind and helpfull, rooms on first floor very clean, every day new towels, swimming pool clean, breakfast modest but OK, toilets and common parts very clean. Lot of places where you can sit with some privacy. Wifi and little bar in reception hall.  Excellent value for money ! "
"11216","Lot of steps (is there a possibility to install an elevator outside of the buildng near to the swimming pool ?), the chairs on the swimming pool are old and broken, it should be obligated to use a towel on this chairs for hygienic reasons.  Some rooms have the noice of the English pub nearby till 2 a.m. in the morning. I missed a drying rack for the beach towels."
"11217","Great location, minutes walk from Potsdamer Platz. Staff are super friendly. Lovely pristine room"
"11218","Bit pricey, €109 a night without breakfast"
"11219","Reception so bad and was lie to us. Pay for internet that we did not get. Angry and not helpfull at al. I Will never come back to this hotel. They must learn to be nice to Their customers. Cold water in the shower exept some houers in the afternoon. Hamam in cold water, feels not nice!!!! I lived in many hotels in turkey and this was the moost bad one. So learn to be nice fix the water and serve some Moore warm food and you Will have a great hotel. "

"11223","Excellent room (478), good breakfast, plenty of sun beds, good location for diving"
"11224","Only 1 a la carte restaurant, alcohol expensive (3.50 euro a beer), poor evening entertainment in hotel and due to location nowhere else to go"
"11225","Very nicely furnished with potential to be a very good hotel."
"11226","Very poor service. If the hotel is going to flourish, it must train it's staff to know what good service, is all about.  Reasonable food just not kept hot, due to the incompetence of the staff. Luxury hotels provide excellent service not poor untrained staff, who are clueless, to what is expected of them.  "
"11227","The location of the hotel could have been better,as it is located to an industriel aerea.      "
"11228","Everything was excellent"
"11229","It was expected the room untouched if a guest hang the sign of pricacy sign on door handle. However room making was perfect."
"11230","Bed and room very comfortable :)"
"11231","The hotel gives an overall 'lush' impression but some features let it down like the bathroom which was rather scummy to be honest. The receptionust was a bit snotty when we checked in!!!  "
"11232","Staff very helpful would like to se coffee and tea making in rooms value for "
"11233","All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful"
"11234","Located in the city center  Clean and Confortable rooms"
"11235","The hotel really needs to be cleaned and renovated!!  Our window, shower, toilet and bed was broken! The minibar was leaking at the carpets- which was not anything new. The room was not cleaned for 4 nights, only our beds were made. The blankets were dirty and so was the carpets. No ventilation. Nothing seems as in the pictures. We would not recommend this hotel. The 3 Stars must have been given 25 years ago.       "
"11236","tiny double room should only be sold as a single room, breakfast bread rolls and cheese only a slice of ham would be good"
"11237","Very handy for exploring Venice from once you have found it."
"11238","Great hotel in midtown Philadelphia. You don´t need a bus or car you can walk everywhere. The employees were very friendly and helpful and the room was really nice. It was clean and comfortable. Another great thing was the outdoor pool in the 8th floor. Everything was great and we really enjoyed our stay in Philadelphia, especially because of the hotel. We can really recommend the Sonesta."
"11239","We were there for 3 days at the start of our honeymoon and we got upgraded to a fantastic large Piazza View suite! Also saw Rock of Ages in the Venetian Theatre which was great!"
"11240","The grand canal is closed inside at the minute for refurbishment and there doesn't seem to be any reduction in the price of the gondola ride to reflect that. Knowing Vegas though it's probably already fixed by now!"
"11241","Very faded hotel could do with being upgraded. And my 15 year old daughter getting propositioned by the middle aged man as she returned to her room was worrying, 50% of the equipment in the gym was missing or broken "
"11242","Exceptional value for money with Hotelopia"
"11243","Was cheap but I applied through a website which indicated the room had it's own bathroom, it did not."
"11244","Clean, friendly staff"
"11245","Very, very small room, no wardrobe.  TV was almost all the time without signal and  Was put on a shelf high enough to not see it  from the bed.  Very small bathroom."
"11246","Good size room, clean and excellent service from housekeeping.   Best location due to close proximity to the airport, local transportation and near Auchan mall.   Definitely best value for the money. "
"11247","Not a lot of other restaurant choices in the vicinity. "
"11248","We booked and pre paid for 3 rooms through hotelopia. Upon arrival we were told that the booking was for 2 rooms only even though we had vouchers for the 3 rooms. The check in staff were hopeless and it took almost 45 minutes for them to correct THEIR error and provide the 3rd room. Although they then confirmed that the rooms had been pre paid  upon checking out we were charged again for each of the rooms. We then spent another 30 minutes sorting out  this additional stuff up at 5.30 in the morning.  As they had already debited our credit cards with these incorrect charges we were hit with bank credit card fees which they would not refund. We would not stay in this hotel again."
"11249","Breakfast was sensational, room and the rest of the hotel was excellent"
"11250","Front desk staff need to have knowledge of the bed configuration in the rooms.  Restaurants were only open for breakfast and closed for both lunch and dinner which for us was an inconvenience to have to go to the other hotels. Room a little on the small size.  Had to ask staff at least 2 to 3 times before our request was granted"
"11251","Lovely and helpful staff  very friendly"
"11252","Didnt like the fact that they charge extra $45 a night for parking  djould vome with the room "
"11253","Nice lobby and you have Starbucks in the lobby. "
"11254","Perfect setting, beautiful view from room and hotel itself. "
"11255","Location is handy to restaurants and beach. Staff were very friendly and helpful."
"11256","Some noise impact from adjacent building works but this is beyond Sofitel's control."
"11257","The staff were all very friendly and happy in their work and made us feel very welcome. They couldn't do enough for us.  The facility for helping ourselves to drinks at any time instead of waiting to be served was a very good idea. Everything was just lovely. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
"11258","The location was excellent, in the center point of the city, everything is near by walking."
"11259","Nothing bad to specific."
"11260","Great breakfast, coffee black as tar, juice from sealed cartons not diluted rubbish, croissants to die for, melon slices that needed two hands, toast making machine with the right bread for toasting. The only thing I was a bit uneasy about was the amount of uncovered food and yes there were flies around. If you go for other meals you will fine the starter a meal in itself. Drinks were a bit hefty - E3.50 for a pint but I go back to the days when a pint was 100 Pesetas. I was booked as a single but was given a junior suite with a double bed (no wife pinching the bedclothes, wunderbar!). Plenty of furniture and storage space, lights and sockets unlike the hotel I stayed in a couple of weeks ago in Berlin. Bathroom well equipped, had a bidet but no bathtub. Towels changed daily. Though the room had a/c it wasn't working very well but I was cool enough at night, bit like Cyprus where I did a tour with the RAF. The covered over pool was not huge but was very private. No hotel car parking but I never had a problem finding a space along the road outside the hotel and the roads themselves are not narrow and pokey like mainland Spain cities such as Barcelona.  I haven't mentioned the staff - I found them smiling, cheerful and helpful. The ones that did not speak a lot of English still knew enough to get by with my equally poor Spanish and hand signs. Say, "" No habla Espanol"" to a young Spaniard and you will probably be replied to in fluent English! I cannot understand why the Jeni is a only a one star - it beats the pants off many higher rated hotels I have stayed in across Europe and I do 6 to 10 European trips a year. I should also mention that the Jeni is popular with Spanish people, always a good sign and the ones I encountered always acknowledged my presence with a smile and greeting and Gibraltar and the Falklands didn't get in the ."
"11261","Nothing apart from the uncovered food at breakfast but having said that I certainly didn't go down with any of Montezumas curses!"
"11262","Lovcation and friendly staff"
"11263","Provision of Airport transfer and most important free wifi in the room as became international standard in 4 stars and above hotels"
"11264","great location , friendly staff , easy to get to all the London Tourist sites by Bus, Subway and walking."
"11265","too dificult to find"
"11266","Excellent location, nice bar, nice staff "
"11267"," the stuff around the pool are helpfull and happy most of the time. they organise several activities during all the day!"
"11268","Some of the stuff at the reception are not service minded, they try to get paid for everything i was asking about.    the stuff at the hotel do as they want. It 's just not Professional."
"11269","Placed very central. Ideal for visting the city"
"11270","Staff were very friendly and helpful, rooms were clean, beds comfortable. We were in all three restaurants and could not fault them, wide choice in the buffet restaurant to suit everyone for breakfast and dinner, the theme nights were also good. Shops were only a ten minute walk away. Would definitely go back as our experience was good."
"11271","The piano player every night, not suitable for everyone, we were fed up listening to the same music, thats our opinion and obviously suits older people."
"11272","Great room with balcony 18th floor, good views and mice bathroom...  Breakthrough was great"
"11273","Room service was slow and after realising we were missing the menu, it was more than 45 min before it was sorted- being in a hurry to get to Ricky Martin we left and got something from O Connell street instead"
"11274","Very convenient location and easy to find from google map, I enjoyed my room and the pool and jacuzzi were fab. Found the receptionists very friendly and efficient. Would go back again."
"11275","Big apartment, and a very fine balcon. We have apartment to the pool area. Happyness for that, because apartment to the 25 meter street er very noissy because of a very strong traffic."
"11276","The main waiter every evening try all guest to eat at the hotel. Thats were very irritation to be  ask why we want to eat outside the hotel."
"11277","Service in the  hotell is very bad   i never come back to this hotell  "
"11278","Where to start! Upselling for upgrade, extortionate internet charges, very industrial, corridor to rooms looked like a hospital corridor. Breakfast just average, limited choice, poor presentation. Hotel cars charged about twice the price of regular taxi. Beds small and uncomfortable. Never again"
"11279","I come 10 years to bitez and have been  in an lot of appartments and hotels in this time. And it is an verry good hotel to stay. I will be come back again!"
"11280","No negative revieuws about this hotel, if you dont't like it for this price dan you have to go to an other place."
"11281","Lovely room,  excellent position to enjoy bathing in the Dead Sea. Appreciated the courtesy shuttle bus to the private beach."
"11282","Very noisy a/c spoilt what was otherwise a faultless room, forced to switch it off to try and get some sleep.  Lack of clean towels at the beach so had to make do with drying off in the dressing gown.  Breakfast was adequate but not anything special, continental breakfast, could be only on a Saturday as it was Shabbat, perhaps better on other days of the week, disappointing for price paid."
"11283","I was impressed by the size of the room, the beautiful public areas, the professional and friendly staff and the punctual airport shuttle.  "
"11284","Room was spacious.  Large comfortable bed.  Good views from the 20th floor.   Reception efficient. Concierge helpful."
"11285","Towels very thin, frayed and hard.  Not to the standard expected of this hotel.    Poor housekeeping in the room. - Toilet still dirty from previous guests - not cleaned properly in the 3 days of our stay.  All bathroom surfaces, carpets, and mini kitchen surfaces not cleaned in 3 days.Bathroom glasses not washed on a daily basis.Tissues, soaps and complimentary tea and coffee sachets not replaced. "
"11286","Very pleased  "
"11287","One girl at reception with a surly attitude. Hence less than perfect score for staff  "
"11288"," Looks like family hotel. It could be quite acceptable for 2 days stay but boring for a week.   "
"11289","I thought the breakfast was over priced at 10 euro, I just had a coffee and croissant and it cost me 10 euro each day, that spoiled the other nicer parts, the bar closed too early for us also and the drinks were expensive."
"11290","Excellent location, only ten minutes walk to the old town square.  Spacious room and bathroom, very clean and tidy which is value for money.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Loved this hotel and will come to Swiss hotel again."
"11291","Very clean, comfortable and very nice staff.  Good location, modern room, perfect hotel!"
"11292","Breakfast very very good.  Standardroom good space and well cleaned.  Friendly and helpful staff.  We are definitly staying at this hotel again next trip."
"11293","Garden rooms can be rather a long walk for persons with walking difficulties."
"11294","It was nice rooms with seaview, clean and comfortable. The staff in the restaurant were very professional and nice. Very good with the beach in the near and the poolarea."
"11295","Our group missed to have fresh fruit at breakfast. Too much garbage on the way/stair to the beach and on the beach.  We should like that transfer from the airports to the hotel was possible. There are a lot of smaller hotels and B"
"11296","Food and in particular the desserts; indoor and outdoor pools; hotel beach with sunbeds and umbrella available for free; nice and professional staff. Perfect place to relax with family."
"11297","At the arrival we were offered twice to take a room where bugs were going around the floor as well as on the furniture. Not nice when you check in late in the night after a full day at work and a 3 hours flight with a 21 months kid jumping on your legs. Anyway, after two refusals with clear statement from my end ""this is not a 4 stars service at all"" and ""this is not an economy room, this is an unhealty room"" the message was understood and we were upgraded to a clean and nicely furnished room. We appreciated this move from the management and since that moment our holiday was simply great. Bravo! to all the staff of the hotel."
"11298","Great hotel in a great location. Staff are very helpful and nothing is to much trouble. Rooms are a good size and spotless.  Food is to a high standard and a good selection available. Great pool with plenty of sunbeds."
"11299","It's a cheap but absolutly good hotel. We injoyed the bbq evening thursday night, with live music and free parrot show.  Friendly well English speaking staff.  We also injoyed the breakfast some of the morning, that's cheap but totally wourth it.  All in all very good stay!!"
"11300","Very central location, 10min walk to Covent Garden, convenient close to metro station Russell Square.  Got a room towards inner courtyard - was quiet, as requested.  Room size and beds ok."
"11301","Long due for refurbishment, terrible smell in bathroom - probably mold - no ventilation.  Room ventilation by open window only.  Breakfast (English) was ok but not enjoyable, remembered me of ""school diner"".  "
"11302","A very basic place to stay after a night out with friends.  Would I stay there with my wife? NO."
"11303","Very nice location and nice view. Polite people working in the hotel.  Clean room and bathroom. I highly recommend."
"11304","No tea and coffee facilities provided in the room."
"11305","this was my second time staying at this hotel and again the staff very very friendly and very helpful. The room was  comfortable and well equipped and I enjoyed the food"
"11306","While the room in general was very clean - an item of underwear from a previous guest was lurking in a corner behind the curtain!"
"11307","Disappointed to be woken at 1145 pm by housekeeping vacuuming next door. When we complained we were told we should have put the do not disturb sign on our door.? Staff closed the paradise pool while we were in it on day 1 because someone pooped in the pool. Had to wait 30 minutes for a table at tropics for dinner. When we were finally escorted to our table it hadn't been cleaned from the previous diners. Their was food under the table that was not cleaned up and I sat on a fork which was left on my seat. Also felt as if we were just a number. Most other hotels we have stayed at, staff go out of their  to make you feel special. Not here. Because of the amount of guests staying at the hotel, I would estimate in the thousands, we found it very hard to relax. Hawaii=relaxing(not this hotel)"
"11308","Nice atmosphere and a super friendly staff!"
"11309","Location was nice, unfortunately the weather was not so good. In the breakfast a lot of fresh fruit was excelent."
"11310","The room decor is a little bit outdated and we had a big cockroach in our room, ugh"
"11311","Spotless and lovely clean towels every day., staff friendly and helpful . Entertainment standard excellent.  Overall excellent value for money would recommend.,   Food was good ., we were bed/breakfast and were given choice of 4 types of breakfast.,waitress served.,the first week we had a buffet which we preferred., its more relaxing "
"11312","Small room with hand washbasin in room ., not in bathroom also very small balcony., our room was on the front so if you book ask for quiet room on the back.as they are much bigger  Entertainment only on twice in the two weeks we were there which was disappointing as terrace was packed on those two nights and deserted otherwise., "
"11313","Exactly what it says on the tin - the main areas of the hotel as exquisite in their grandure and it is a pleasure to stay in a real piece of history.  The hotel shares swimming pool and leisure facilities with the neighbouring adjacent hotel.  Amazing sea views from room (we had room 310) and public areas"
"11314","Queue for breakfast of around 10 minutes not welcome.  Bed not overly comfortable.  We had a family room and there was a nightlight on all night and we could not find a  of turning it off (but we did not ask)."
"11315","Nice rooms and bathroom, especially one room with a window. Near to bathing on a bridge and Siracusa old town. A nice balcony outside the rooms."
"11316","2 rroms had only a door with light and no window, but for only a couple of days you can li e with that, but not for a longer stay I think."
"11317","Great position, close to water front and city.Great roof top bar with views.Great value for money.Good restaurants within walking distance"
"11318","Very good position. Worth while paying for sea view. Always could get a sunbed."
"11319","Had to ask for clean towels. Apartment could be cleaner. Lots of residual hair on arrival which couldnt be mine !! Breakfast not great and went out and paid some mornings."
"11320","Really pleased with Mon Port and will stay again. Hotel staff very polite and helpful. We only had breakfast which was excellent and walked down to the port every evening which is only 15 minutes stroll, even with a walk, carry, walk, carry 3 year old. Taxi back up in the evening less than €5. The Hotel do rent bikes if you prefer. The pool is of three definate levels, the lowest ideal for our 3 year old who enjoyed playing pirates with daddy and could acutually stand shoulder deep most part... a little too nippy for me but then it was mid October. There is an indoor pool that was available for use with little boy on the one overcast day we had - brilliant!. All in all, very pretty surroundings in a very pretty Port Andrax which does not allow an skyrise hotels, even Mon Port is hidden from the Port in a dip and extremely pleasant staff. We would definately go back to Mon Port."
"11321","The room was perfectly OK and comfortable and reasonably up to date with a flat screen TV. Again, the bathroom was OK with an excellent power shower in the bath. Both rooms are in keeping with the classic decor of the hotel and updating to extreme modern standards would be out of character. You will have a comfortable stay."
"11322","The staff is lovely!   The girl at reception helped us in everything. She was very professional and kind.   The location is great and next to the hotel there is a lovely restaurant.   Our room was big, and also had a small kitchen full equipped.  Its ideal for young couples, group of friends or to stay alone!"
"11323","A true 5 star hotel. Everything super luxurious.  A beautiful place. Wonderful staff."
"11324","great breakfast room manager.....friendly and helpful with gluten free sourcing of food    amusing slim lift    great location"
"11325","The hotel is in a place MAGIC ...  The wildlife in front of our eyes ...  Caroline and Foro is a friendliness and attention to customers out of this world ...  When it came out of a place like this brings up a tear in the corner of the eye, for the rest of life."
"11326","Location is not the greatest, access is through the local petrol station to get to the hotel. The room was absolutely fine, not to a great standard but certainly nothing was wrong. It was clean, well lit and moderately well furnished, it worked as a place to sleep for the night, for which it was designed. Dining room is more an office canteen and currently undergoing renovation, Breakfast was included in the price and was more than adequate, although severely limited in choice, particularly the cooked food. Would I recommend the hotel? On balance yes, it was fine for the money but don't expect too much."
"11327","Friendly staff, near the beach, relaxing place"
"11328","Very nice place to stay but smaller than thought, would stay again"
"11329","The stay at your hotel was one of the most relaxed I have felt, the staff were all very friendly and ensured you had everything you required.  The atmosphere was warm and friendly, I would stay again without hesitation."
"11330","Toilet flush and bathroom sink/plug could do with being up-dated - they are not easy to use (especially for someone with a touch of arthritis!) "
"11331","Great old hotel with wonderful ceramics and super location  Would stay again"
"11332","Facilities good by Moroccan standards but basic in international terms"
"11333","i have to pay Extra 2 nights its not good i inform your hotel and phone number also but not good reply and i stay 8 nights and i have to pay for 10 nights   "
"11334","I stayed for three nights in October. The room (double for single occupancy) on the 4rth floor, was very clean, with a very comfortable bed. TV has Spanish channels only which was ok for me as I speak Spanish. Free Wifi in the room. In the bathroom, shampoo/shower gel and soap. I did not have breakfast, so I cannot comment about food quality.  The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the nearest Metro Station (Monumental) and 10 minutes walk from the Bus station Nord (Bus to Girona airport). The staff was friendly and very helpful. Next time I travel to Barcelona, I will again choose this hotel for my stay."
"11335","Wonderful staff, brilliant breakfast and only sorry I didn't have time to use the swimming pool"
"11336","My only niggle would be that I would have preferred a double bed for single use as I always fall out of a single bed, so didn't get much sleep!  I didn't ask to change my room so I can't blame the hotel"
"11337","Good location for nec. Courtesy bus good. Have stayed twice and got great price for room and breakfast."
"11338","Had to make down kids bed and too few large towels for family of 4 (2 given)"
"11339","The room and staff were excellent but a power failure and appliances not functioning were the reason for not scoring top marks. Sorry. many Thanks  Graeme Mac"
"11340","Reception changed our room immediately we expressed our wish to move because of noisy fan outside. Staff were very friendly and helpful."
"11341","Good location , clean hotel ,fresh food ,friendly stuff "
"11342","You have to pay extra for the WiFi in the room , the food was almost the same everyday ,pure alcohol menu "
"11343","Clean hotel, nice outdoor facilities, large dining area, near beach"
"11344","Cold water in pool (compared to beach in October)"
"11345","I've visited this place many times and that may say it all.  What I find important is there, clean rooms, okay beds, comfortable and nicely  furnished rooms. The pool area and gardens are extraordinarily   beautiful. The place is kept clean very well and is often not over crowded. Personnel is friendly and speak  various languages. I've once again, had a very comfortable stay at Las Marismas.  People truly give you the impression that you're welcome. I'll definitely come back!"
"11346","Nothing Negative, one more tennis court would be nice though..."
"11347","The service was outstanding. The room absolutely fantastic"
"11348","Beds far to small for 2 people   "
"11349","Friendly reception staff didn't use the dinning facilities stayed because we were at a friend's wedding. Room was comfortable nice hotel."
"11350","Bathroom seemed like it was renovated recently, nice and clean.  Public area seemed clean and tidy."
"11351","The location of the hotel is exellent. One bedroom apartment, that we rented, was very spacious and clean, breakfast good."
"11352","The kitschen was equiped not sufficient, various items were missing, but it doesn't bother much as we dined outside. The view through windows should be better, not to the wall of other building and noise isolation also need improvement. "
"11353","Despite the fact that this was one of the most expensive hotels to choose in Trondheim the weekend of October 11th, 2013 we were not happy. Good location - otherwise the hotel was quite ordinary. I had asked for two single beds rather than one double - this was not arranged for. The breakfast area was totally crowded and the room was ok - nothing special. Service level ordinary. I will look for another option next time in Trondheim."
"11354","We spent twelve nights on our honeymoon at the Hotel Dorado full board in October 2013. On the second day we up graded to the All inclusive as we thought we would make use of all the booze that this lets you have- upgrade cost €13.60 per person (not bad if you wanted as much drink as you like outside of meal times- but we did not make full use of if as we got sick of being around the hotel every day and evening drinking). variety of beers and sprits were good- as they served local and non local alcohol i.e bottles of Heineken, jameson, gordons gin etc  We saw lots of people in wheel chairs and seemed to be able to get around quite easily with all the ramps- this I thought was a great positive about the hotel and they have to be commended for this.  There was an indoor swimming pool, jacussi, sauna, steam room and the outside swimming pools- all well kept and maintained. The whole place was well kept with cleaners and maintenance people visible day and night.   Waiting staff in the restaurant  were friendly and attentive, chefs in restaurant were not."
"11355","As mentioned earlier I said we stayed for twelve nights for honeymoon in October 2013. In my booking (in the comment box) I had asked for a bottle of champagne to be left in the room for a surprise for my wife. When we got to our room late in the evening/night there was no champagne. I went down to the reception and asked the receptionist where was our champagne. He was not being apologetic or nice about it and he said that we could not get any champagne unless we paid in advance, now after spending €1500 a bottle of champagne was the least I thought we could get even if I did have  to pay for it on our bill afterwards. I wouldn't put any special requests in the comment box when booking the hotel online as they obviously do not read the comments/requests left by the guest. It seemed like you had to be a deluxe paying guest to get even a smile from the staff. Oh by the  you do get a glass of cheep champagne (plonk) on arrival if you are a deluxe guest but not on your honeymoon. Cocktails were very poor quality and not well made- definitely would not pay €5.30 or €7.00 euro for these if we were not all inclusive, as you can get proper cocktails down the strip for the same price and cheaper. All in all reception staff were not good but maybe sometimes restricted by the hotel polices. Food although we though good at the start got  repetitive and a change of scenery required after three days (again all inclusive was a waste on us). Hotel did not did not do packed lunches for day trips.  Although we did make use of all inclusive now and again, but definitely did not drink or eat our moneys worth.  Staff at the bars were ok. They did not speak much English and could not have fun with them much. They were often slow and did not know who to serve next.  I didn't think that this was a four star hotel but 3*."
"11356","We have stayed at this hotel many times over many years and still love it.  Everything is clean, well looked after and well maintained.  We think it is worth staying on the Level.  The staff are helpful and professional and 'listen' to what we have to say.  Particular thanks to David and Jacqui for all their care and attention.  We will return, thank you both for making our holiday as relaxed as possible."
"11357","Great location, 5 mins from the airport, and right across the road from the railway station, 20 mins walk from the leaning tower.. The staff were very helpful, and friendly. The breakfast was good , with a good selection. Great experience overall"
"11358","Was really impressed with how close it was to the beach and also the quality of the rooms for the money we paid"
"11359","Only negative I could say is the lack of outdoor area but as it's so close to the beach we found it wasn't too much of the problem we first thought. "
"11360","This is totally not a hotel! Management is unacceptable! Waited 4 hours just to check in. And end up couldnt check in because the hotel management did not have my booking record from Hotelopia! Ruined my entire taiwan trip! Extremely worst hotel management! "
"11361","Searched for a last minute room for a short notice night out with friends. My Single room here was nearly half the price of any other option in Brighton last Saturday. The decor was ever so slightly tired but absolutely fine for the price and the place had much more charm than one of the chain hotels. My room was small but perfectly adequate; TV, shower, wifi, phone all worked fine. Breakfast was really very good and only a few pounds when booked in advance. At this price my friends thought I would wake up with a missing kidney, but when they picked me up in the morning they were all quite surprised at the good standard."
"11362","These are not major criticisms, but for completeness and in case these things matter to you:  The hotel has some parking, but it's limited so don't rely on it.  There are some rooms with a sea view if thats your thing, but mine had no view (pipes and bricks). The non picturesque side of the hotel is most likely the quietest side - the hotel  is right on the beachfront road, not directly in the heart of the night life zone but don't expect silence. I got back at 5am and the town is still buzzing. The night manager was good at keeping reveller noise down.  Check in was slightly slow, and I had to remind them about my breakfast order. Both mistakes pretty forgivable in my view.   Overall much more good than bad and a solid 4 "
"11363","At cousins wedding - fantastic hotel, very good service and staff."
"11364","Very nice and modern hotel, with very polite and friendly staff."
"11365","Nice room, nice view. Clean and comfortable.   Not really excited about paying $24 per night to park our car, but I understand that's the San Diego norm....I would suggest that cost be incorporated into the room cost as it appears to be really cheesy."
"11366","The room I got was small and not according to the picture I have seen when I made the reservation "
"11367","The Langham Xintiandi is a wonderful hotel in a brilliant location. The staff are friendly, professional and always ready with useful knowledge. The general facilities are all beautifully decorated and our room was wonderful. We upgraded to the club floor which meant that we had breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks in the evening included in our room cost. I would do this again if we ever manage to return! The breakfast was abundant and delicious, with a huge variety of cold and hot food. Our afternoon tea was a pleasant addition to the trip and the drinks in the evening provided an array of delicious canapes accompanied by drinks overlooking the lovely Xintiani setting.     Our room was gorgeous, modern and bright with views over the area. I loved our nespresso machine in the bedroom and particularly enjoyed the ""night light"" - a dim light which paved the  from our bed to the bathroom when the main lights were off, meaning there was no possibility of tripping up in the middle of the night!     The hotel was really wonderful. "
"11368","The only issue, and it was very slight, that we had with this hotel was the swimming pool. It seems badly designed, with marble stairs leading from the pool to ""jacuzzi"". I was concerned about slipping. The jacuzzi was a little pathetic and probably not worth making the trip for. That being said the pool area was decorated well and the changing rooms left us wanting for nothing. "
"11369","Shockingly cheap, in a good area (Zone 2), plenty of transport and 3 mins from Swiss Cottage Tube.    Near to local shops and amenities.    Free Breakfast and Wi-Fi.    Beds have privacy curtains, as well as personal light and power points for 2 plugs."
"11370","As it is a hostel, you really do get what you pay for.  As it was an overnight stay I didn't mind, although I haven't used bunk beds since I was a young child, and felt it very uncomfortable trying to get in and out of bed, and nearly slipped off the ladder.    So really should have wished I requested a lower tier bunk.    Also, if you aren't familiar with hostels, remember to take a towel and toiletries with you, or be prepared to buy them yourself.  There are lockers but you need your own padlock.    The rooms are ok, I admit they were a tad tatty looking, however the main thing is the bedding etc was clean, it may have been because there is a lot of traffic, i.e. a lot of people in and out of the room.    Also the rooms have the main light permanently on, so use your privacy curtains on your bed.    Can feel very stuffy and claustraphobic, the mattress was ok, but I admit it wasn't the most comfortable of sleeps.    But seriously for the price I paid, I really shouldn't be too picky - I went to London on a budget, and I stuck to it."
"11371","Just could have done with a little pool perhaps but that's just preference and its not really a negative"
"11372","House keeping kept waking us up and walked in the toom"
"11373","- Good C/P ratio  - Very convenient with lots of shopping nearby"
"11374","- Bad housekeeping - you could find dusts everywhere in the room.  - Not Four Seasons standard"
"11375","Excellent the staff were very helpful.The location was very handy and a nice safe feel to it. Would go back. "
"11376","it was a very enjoyable stay overnight will use the hotel again in the future thank you very much "
"11377","everything"
"11378","lovely place to stay"
"11379","Everthing was nice. Neli (the owner) is very welcoming and warm lady. Thanks for everthing and if we come to the island again, we will stay at this hotel for sure!"
"11380","Very nice room  Very comfortable bed  Good location with plenty of shops and restaurants (although some might consider the hotel to be too far away from the city center)"
"11381","Aircon didn't cool, just heat (at least when we were there)  Wifi reception is poor and speed slow  Pillows sub-standard  Surroundings a bit dodgy"
"11382","Slow to fix defects like broken phone handset  Tv old and diff to operate.  No TV guide "
"11383","Nicely positioned in quiet area, good pool area"
"11384","The room could not have been cleaned for weeks. Full with old hair every ware and Cockroaches."
"11385","Very friendly staff, specially at the reception (Hortensia)  Good service: if you have to leave early, you can make an reservation for early breakfast (just ask at the reception)  Good location: beach "
"11386","None!  (although.. wifi availibity in the room would be nice, now only in the lounge)"
"11387","Great hotel and facilities."
"11388","  Management  must take responsibility to do follow up on each room, if it is up to standard.    I always book at Protea hotel in Kwazylu Natal- their service are 100%  "
"11389","great hotel  good beach  good restaurants  several pools"
"11390","Hotel was easy to find. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was new. Good range of facilities."
"11391","Parking while plentiful was an additional cost. At check in staff did not mention wifi access. Staff was helpful. Beware of misrepresentation."
"11392","We asked the reception to make a wake up call at 5h00 so we dont miss our flight and they never called us!! luckily we had our phone alarms"
"11393","Rooms were a good size. Staff were nice.  Really nice place to stay. Would stay here again.   Would not have dry cleaning done here again  "
"11394","Rooms were not cleaned everyday.  Had some items dry cleaned and came back not pressed   and suit collar in the wrong place. The staff member didn't charge   us the $12 on the mini bar because of the dry cleaning issue that   Cost us $48  Hotel was undergoing renovations at the time that begun early"
"11395","People are very friendly."
"11396","Great value and good standard for the price. Staff lovely. Had use of pool and jacuzzi which was great too."
"11397","Very nice room. The staff was kindly and professionell.."
"11398","The pool was dirty and needed cleaning. The breakfast was poor I miss some eggs and bacon. I also missed good coffe. It was served in big cans and was not warn enough. It was probably a sort of instant coffe. I saw a real coffemachine in the kitchen and also a grinder for coffe. So I Think this could be a lott better for the guests."
"11399","The view! The staff were friendly but no action was taken after any problems were raised."
"11400","Not explaining that there is a charge of 1.50€ per day for the kettle, no fridge and the safe key was 20€ deposit plus 1.50€ per day, if people are budgeting, this is a lot of money outgoing before the holiday starts. Also the restaurant/bar made the rules up on a daily basis. We were actually drinking one night and they just turned out the lights while we were there and never said to us that they were closing. The restaurant owner has no concern for his clients. Bed and breakfast has a different menu to half board clients and their menu is really bad. The hotel is lacking maintenance on certain areas."
"11401","Shuttle bus to Disney park is PERFECT !!. Also parking for the car is good.  Room are looking good, big enough and all necessary facilities are their,"
"11402","The cleanliness wasn't good this time. It was our third stay and the worst !!  The kitchen was not clean, several knives and spoons were disappeared and also too less glasses.  The TV did not work properly for 1 night, 1 lamp in the bathroon wasn't function and the second day os our stay we did not have the big towels after cleaning the room.  We have spend better days then this last stay. I hope the hotel will not decrease the service as we expected from some time ago."
"11403","Very friendly helpful reception. Very convenient for the Airport. Superb local bus service into central Venice.  Excellent value for money. Appreciated courtesy bus transfer back to Airport. "
"11404","Good selection of food at mealtimes which was fresh and well cooked.   Hotel well situated for centre of resort while being in a tranquil location."
"11405","Bar prices extremely high,so did not use much. the price of using computer facilities also very high,so again did not use."
"11406","Hotel was clean and tidy especially love the Bright Blue yeti curtains, Continental breakfast was adequate  "
"11407","But what spoilt it for me was the poor cooked breakfast, all for the sake of a descent Sausage and Piece of Bacon."
"11408","I took what was described as a single room with sea view. It turned out to be a large double room with excellent facilities and kept very clean. The sea view was perfect. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would return."
"11409","A very slight niggle but nothing to spoil the holiday - the logistics at breakfast were good until you had to queue for 'fresh eggs' - perhaps an additional cook in peak times would have been appropriate. I would not want prospective clients to be put off by this comment. "
"11410","Fantastic hotel, location brilliant and the views from the terrace are brilliant especially at night will definitely use the hotel again and recommend it."
"11411","The staff are excellent, very friendly and efficient"
"11412","you will be satisfied to fullest. "
"11413","sitting arrangement on the entry or lobby would be appreciated "
"11414","Great location and the staff were fantastic"
"11415","Lovely stay over the weekend with some friends. Very close to the city centre! Hotel was very nice and clean, would defantly come back here again. "
"11416","I booked 5 rooms for the weekend for myself and a group of friends for a Birthday celebration. Upon arrival we were told we would need to pay an extra £100 per room as a deposit, this came to us as a shock and also we did not prepare ourselves to be spending an extra £100 per room. We were told that this was in the term and conditions and was due to the large booking we had made, although this was not explained to me when i made the booking. I felt this was quite unfair as if we had known would have book each room seperately."
"11417","The view from the Deluxe rooms' balcony on the highest floor are to die for. Very tranquill scenary of padi fields, river and mountains in the distance. Gorgeous, well maintained landscaping around hotel. Very spacious hotel grounds with lots of beautiful trees and shrubs and a joy to sit at the balcony and do nothing and just soak in the peaceful atmostphere. 2 computers are free to use in the small libary. Lots of bicycles for guests' free use - very useful since hotel is not within Pai centre (5 mins on bicycle). Free 2-way Songtheow shuttle service is also provided for guests to get into town. Rather good value considering all the facilities provided."
"11418","The superior rooms are very poorly maintained. These are all on the ground floor, just below the hotel reception and restaurant. Curtain, chair cushion cover and lamp shade are badly stained and shower room reeks of odour from poor drainage system. Table and chairs at the porch of superior rooms are very dusty. Better to pay slightly more for deluxe rooms for much better views and slightly better cleanliness. Stayed during off-peak period so room rate was attractive. Peak period rates are too high for the not-thoroughly cleaned or maintained room. This website's rate is better than the other usual booking sites for this hotel."
"11419","Location very good, close to railwaystation and plenty of restaurants."
"11420","Location negative for those having problem with noise from the street.  The bathroom in our room was extremely small, and with no possibility for using electrical appliances. The separate toilet had just enough room for a small child. Closing the door behind a grown man i almost impossible!  Wearing shoes inside is recommended because of dirty carpet on the floor. There was free WiFi in the hotel, but it worked only in the lobby.."
"11421","very helpful staff   good location  very peaceful  "
"11422","I had the best week Ever!"
"11423","The Water in the pool was cold, 18 celcius"
"11424","great hotel wouldnt think of staying anywhere else when visiting Blackpool again  fantastic breakfast everything you would want"
"11425","really could do with injection of cash for refurbish programme as looking bit tired  mattress a bit firm for me"
"11426","Very pleased with our stay. Staff were helpful and friendly. Room clean and containing all necessary amenities. Overall very good value -  would happily use the hotel again in future!."
"11427","A very good stay apart from the woman behind the desk in the morning she had a conversation with the couple in front about how their stay was hope they had a good day when it was out turn to hand in the room keys she didn't say a word to us and was very rude. She was not professional at all we never did anything to her so was confused as to why she ignored us but happily spoke to the couple in the front. "
"11428","Staff are friendly and polite.  Restaurant was interested in my satisfaction with the food and willing to go the exra mile to meet my requirements.  Room service is good."
"11429","Regarding arrivals out front of the hotel - there is room for improvement, no one to greet you on arrival.  Staff took 2 hours to provide a camp cot.  Towels were forgotten on one of the days."
"11430","Great location - on the main street but not in a noisy part, close to the Metro and all other facilities,   Room with Balcony - great room and very clean  breakfast - very good, and very good service  we enjoyed our stay in this hotel - will be back! "
"11431","REally enjoyed my stay at this hotel and I  couldn't have been more comfortable.  Its location was great. The staff were very helpful at keeping our bags as we arrived early am and left in the evening time. I can't give the hotel a 5 as I didnt have any food in the hotel but it did look lovely when passing through the bar area"
"11432","Over-all Good, Meals Good, Staff very friendly and always ready to assist"
"11433","I stayed at a suite with large bath room and two toilets. The executive lounge is a bouns for me, where I had my breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour in very reflex  and most importantly free of charge. The swimming pool is excellent. I would recommend anyone who are looking for a restort in Bangkok. If you book a suite or executive room, you are entitled to use the executive lounge it is worth for you to pay the extra for this option."
"11434","The bedroom was nice, adequate, and some of their personnel really helpful and nice.  La habitación estaba bien, y algunos de sus empleados eran realmente amables y atentos."
"11435","simple room with minimun facilities"
"11436","Super swimming pool and saunas.    One of the best restaurants in Poland"
"11437","bad quality service of staff "
"11438","Our original room had a faulty air con unit.  We were moved and had a free upgrade to a suite for the inconvenience.  The staff were polite, friendly and helpful at all times.      A 20 min stroll brings you to the gates of Universal.  There are two major road crossings and lesser roads to be covered but all have pedestrian crossings.  The hotel is well placed for travelling to all the major theme park attractions.  "
"11439","Food served at the wedding we attended was excellent. Staff were very friendly during the course of our stay.   The view overlooking the Glen of the Down from the dining room during breakfast was fabulous.   Convient location with easy access to the Dublin road.   Garden grounds were excellent and well maintained."
"11440","Very good location within easy reach of city center.Staff very polite "
"11441","Just the fact had to pay for parking but than it is situated near a airport."
"11442","The free wifi is very slow. Why to be obliged to pay for a proper conexion?  This is not acceptable for a working environment in the heart of Europe."
"11443","We loved this hotel. The location was great and the staff were very nice and friendly. We had the use of a free safe and wi fi and a flat screen tv in our room. There was free toiletries every day and the rooms were spotless."
"11444","None really"
"11445","Good location, wifi excellent, breakfast good and staff friendly and professional."
"11446","Great hotel,  Terrific Scenery  Staff most hospitable."
"11447","There were more facilities than we had expected and lots of room for relaxing by the pool. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is located conveniently close to a beach, grocery store and some interesting nights spots. "
"11448","The food in the restaurant was over priced for its quality, and the water in the pool was freezing! Taxi's from the airport are expensive and unless you go with a guided tour be prepared to pay a lot of money for transportation. "
"11449","????,????,???OK,???u-bahn??,??????????,????????,?????????????,????????,??????????,???????  The room was clean, decor is very new, the breakfast is OK. Hotel is pretty close to the u-bahn, and located just right in the city centre, Behind the hotel, there is the Gendarmenmarkt. You can walk only a short distance to Checkpoint Charlie, and shopping malls are also close to hotel, this is indeed very convenient."
"11450","??????????????,???????????;??????????!  Standard twin room as small as incredible, shower location is also quite strange. The attendant quality could be better..."
"11451","Appreciated the quirkiness, interior architecture, views and history of this hotel.  Breakfast spread much appreciated."
"11452","With tongue in cheek - parking the car!  But it is in the Tangier medina."
"11453","Nice hotel, good location. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful - many thanks from us, particularly to Annie who went out of her  to make our stay pleasant."
"11454","The staff were helpful and pleasant. "
"11455","Fantastic time at the Caribe. Food excellent with loads of choice , proper bacon and sausage and even black pudding. Lovely pool area with loads of seating and sunbeds. AI drinks superb with proper san Miguel lager."
"11456","Only negative was room balcony , we had room 103 above the entrance of the hotel , all rooms on this side had no sun all day , which was a pity. Try and get a room with a pool view !"
"11457","Very small bathroom  Bath too high to enter for people with problems  Shower taps placed immediately beneath the shower head and shower fixed to wall so head wet every time."
"11458","Reminiscent of an English country manor house, the rooms were huge, as we're the bathrooms. The one we stayed in was decorated in a classical style, with a huge open fireplace. Fresh fruit, tea, coffee, biscuits "
"11459","Whilst the rooms are great "
"11460","prepare 200 aed = $50 as a security deposit or someting"
"11461","Excellent hotel - would definitely return"
"11462","great hotel will definitely be back"
"11463","Everything was working well and hotel was clean and in very good place. People were friendly and service was really good."
"11464","Rooms could have been little bit bigger and have more space for luggage and clothes. Food was ok but some more variation in meat dishes, sausages, hams, cheese and  fish foods could have been good. Salads were ok, soups mainly did not taste very good.After one week everything started to taste the same and we all were waiting to get something else to eat. But overall everything was ok."
"11465","Staff helpful - freindly and price very god for London."
"11466","Very short distance to the beach. Clean room. Size of the room. Wifi 100%.        "
"11467","The Hotel needs a general overhaul. Also the furniture in the kitchenette in our room.  The included breakfast is really nothing. Also the space to have breakfast in the reception. "
"11468","Very clean, nice location, great pools and some good entertainment (Jersey Boys)"
"11469","Really amazing facilities...for a family"
"11470","Food and drinks  overpriced"
"11471","Nice and quiet for business travels"
"11472","internet was the worse ever seen an any hotel.  Breakfast was not good. Room were not good.  Beds were hard and very light, low quality."
"11473","Very nice hotel in a quiet area of Venice; just in front of a vaporetto station"
"11474","The staff and location of this hotel are fantastic.  We really enjoyed staying here.  I felt it was good value for money given the location."
"11475","This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was grubby with marks on the walls and torn curtains. The toilet cistern was leaking constantly. When the toilet couldn't be fixed they moved us to another room which was slightly cleaner, but the bed in this room was missing one of its legs and we had to prop it up with a phone book. The pool water was cloudy."
"11476","Perfect place for family.   Great food, service, pool.  Will be back next year. "
"11477","Apart from a few problems with small ants invading the kitchen area our main frustratiion was transport. While the Hotel runs a shuttle service during the day this stops @ 5 PM and to get to the centre taxis must be used. It could take anything from 10mins to 30 mins for a taxi to arrive (sometimes longer if other groups were also waitimg) Prices  varied considerably for very similar journeys. I accept that much of this is beyond the control of the Hotel management but I do feel they should try to get a better agreement on service and price with the taxi operators. Alternatively could they perhaps provide a shuttle in the evenings at set times (say 7PM, "
"11478","Great location.   Close to train "
"11479","- Noisy. We could hear dogs barking from opposite apartment. We could hear the TV, hair dryers and people talking from the room next to us.   - Bathroom is not great. Dirty tiles and bath. No water pressure in showers. No evaporative system in bathroom.  - Room hasn't been vacuumed for the entire 5 days we were there. They were also chips on the floor from the previous person.  - Aircon not working properly."
"11480","The room was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was in a very good position and easy to find."
"11481","The room needed a bit of TLC  but I think they were doing it up because some of the halls and public tools were done up nice. "
"11482","Beatifuful hotel and pools. Beach is also stunning. On comment is the wifi is only in lobby and there is only 1 computer if you don't have your own device. Still highly recommend. "
"11483","Really enjoyed our stay, highly recommended.   Will be back!"
"11484","The staff on reception were extremely helpful on every occasion I was making an enquiry especially Roy. I would certainly like to think I would use this hotel again when visiting the NEC centre. Please pass on my sincere thanks to them."
"11485","situated in a nice area on the waterfront, with shopping mall just across the road. The Royal Yacht Britannia and Princes street just a short distance away. Would recommend the Hotel "
"11486","Clean room, comfort bed, nice view  Good value with self drive car"
"11487","the Hotel is perfect for relaxing, it is quiet and peaceful and rounded by a nice landscape.  Rooms are clean and bright and they have a nice terrace where you can enjoy the sunset.  The beach is clean as well as the sea."
"11488","The hotel is ideal for short staying because of its isolated position. It's one hour driving far from Muscat. The beach in not good for children because of has sharp rocks and the access to the sea  is quite difficult, You need water shoes indeed. "
"11489","Disgusting mosquito infested hell hole, constant Dehli Belly from mouldy recycled food, bad attitude restaurant manager, stalker excursion/salon man. Never again."
"11490","Debbie on reception was very welcoming, polite, friendly and helpful. Breakfast room staff also cheerful and friendly. All makes a big difference to the experience. Location is in a quiet side of town, Charing Cross Station around the corner and main shops within 15 minute walk. Excellent, reliable free WiFi internet.  Room was large, quiet, nice and dark in the morning so had great lie-ins. Great shower room.  Limited , but tasty breakfast, self service but that's cool with me.  A big thanks."
"11491","The hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly. Great breakfast in the morning. It's about a half an hour walk to the centre but has a good bus route that can be accessed next to the hotel. We would definitely go back on our next trip to Edinburgh! "
"11492","Amazing views and very well equipped. Clean, quite and a great location. "
"11493","Had a wonderful stay, highly recommend."
"11494","Despite some of the poor reviews we booked for two nights in Oct to visit the nearby NEC.  Our room (336) was clean and more than adequate for the price we payed (Room only £88:00).  Staff were pleasant and helpful and our evening meal in the restaurant was lovely although a little  overpriced."
"11495","The corridors leading up to our room were a bit 'Tatty' and require redecorating.  Were charged £8:50 for parking which should be free parking for residents.  "
"11496","I have stayed here 3times good place.close ti good eateries and heeps of night cuubs.  "
"11497","Really nice small hotel in a great location for exploring the city.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly."
"11498","Very professional,very good quality, nice atmosphere, friendly personal, very good buffets, near the beaches, shops and promenade."
"11499","After check-out very poor facilitys to take a shower and redress. Hard to find location and a long  to carry your suitcases due to many stairs."
"11500","Although we had booked a month ahead and received confirmation of booking la Cabana had moved our reservation to a cheaper and non attractive hotel on the non attractive main street in town.  All in all we would have been pleased with the Cabana, but moving us to the lousy hotel was NOT acceptable."
"11501","Parking too expensive $30 a night."
"11502","The rooms could do with a good clean ie lots of cobwebs and dirty floor after being washed with dirty water the water should be changed from room to room rips in sheets no soap and opened ashbins outside our bathroom window which smelt room 24 used towel not bath mat on shower base as very very slippery."
"11503","Very busy breakfast room, had to wait for cutlery, cups, glasses for juice. Not enough staff on duty to cope with the amount of patrons.The food was fine,  but a wee tip , the toaster takes for ever, so make it before you help yourself to the sausage  and eggs."
"11504","Full of mosquito, food is not eatable, if you don't leave tips cooking stuff don't want to see your face, you can not enter beach without special shoes, full of rocks, working staff does not want to help you, looks like they work for somebody else but not for you to give nice holidays stay, if you come one day before your booking, do not forget that you can't book hotel from internet on the hotel and you will be charged double."
"11505","Good Location. Friendly staff."
"11506","Beach is not as good as we expected. However, it is closed to the hotel."
"11507","Yes, it is cheap, neighborhood isnt great but definitely not hostile. very close to public transport, less than 5minute walk from the metro, or less the one minute walk from the tram stop Jean Rostand."
"11508","There is an air circulation fan in the room. it is LOUD and it cannot be stopped or made quieter. made four nights of sleep really difficult. staff were pretty rude and didnt have time to deal with anyone. wifi in the lobby only which was annoying when they put you on the 10th floor and the lift broke down one day. "
"11509","Very touristic."
"11510","This is the second time we have stayed in the hotel and enjoyed it thoroughly though only for one night this time. "
"11511","Great Apartments. Not to far from city center.Nice swimming pool. A   "
"11512","A great resort for families. A lot of activities for the Whole Family."
"11513","Staff and room.,,,and parking!"
"11514","Not so happy with the new restaurant-design,,,, too open and can feel noisy,,,, chair is terrible unconfortable,,,, a big miss!! Mini -ipad meny can work, but you miss personal feeling. My food, lambsteek?, was served on a small "" banana-split"" plate,,,,a big miss, too,,,,, perhaps a little too much feeling of micro-prepared. So, I miss the ""old"" restaurant and excellent food !! "
"11515","Dust everywhere in the room, hot water off for 24 hrs and when I asked and complained to the staff for couple times, they even didn't say sorry."
"11516","Excellent service from entering the hotel, very clean "
"11517","Suffers building noise from large developments on JBR and the Dubai Eye, both in the rooms and more so round the pool. Pool area is small and has restricted sun, limited beach access around the building works. Traffic access to the hotel is busy due to ongoing tram works. "
"11518","near to kl sentral, easy to travel around."
"11519","perfect place to stay"
"11520","Beautifully decorated hotel, spacious rooms. Excellent staff and service, you are being felt very welcome by everyone from Manager to porter, valet parking staff and cleaning ladies. For children very nice surprises. Good pool and sea facilities. Will certainly return."
"11521","Good position close to underground, cinema, restaurants "
"11522","Breakfast needs to be improved"
"11523","Location is quite convenience. 7-11 store at 1/F is good for hotel guest. "
"11524","If shuttle bus can go many more places "
"11525","Very professional staff.  Clean facilities.  Easy to find -- on a main street.  10-15min walk to downtown."
"11526","Bathroom feels cramped with two people, but on par with most of Greece."
"11527","Central, nice room, big tv, nice breakfast and quiet"
"11528","When we checked in I asked for a confirmation that we had breakfast inc. She confirmed. Every three mornings we stayed they stopped us and told that we didnt have the name on the list. Thats not good. I came there with my 2 sons, and three times they stopped us. When they checked with the desk, it was ok. Should not be necessary at all. I must mention that the staff stopping us was friendly and did not make a big number out of it.   There was a coffee bar in the lobby. When we visited at 10 on saturday evening we met a bartender that was not having a good day. I guess so. I stop with that. I  have been around and know that service is usually good in GB. Next time better:)  By the . Wifi should be free. "
"11529","Perfect location, on the Osterport station, 10 minuts walk to the Little Mermaid, 15 mins from the Royal Castle and 20 mins from the Nyhavn. Basic hotel facilities and rooms, but OK. Good value for money."
"11530","this hotel is top of the town,very well run, amazing food and service"
"11531","room 3 can be a bit noisey as it is above the bar,?"
"11532","Wakin at reception tried! "
"11533","Air con turned off by directors decision - gave us noisy fan - outside terrace had sewerage drain that really stunk at some times of day rm 304 - toxic wasteland - ants paradise - open windows let tennis flood lights keep us awake - tasteless sparse breakfast - a joke !! - rhink hotel is run by young  - lots of shady characters hanging around - noisy tennis across the road - smokers at entrance comes up thru windows day n night - we def had worst room in hotel - beds so hard woke with sore back n hips - was told hotel was fully booked so cant change rooms when complained air con not working - but plain to see hotel not full. Told diff excuse about air con not working - the only good thing about this crappy place was Wakin - the young man on reception during the day - he tried to help and was kind - he told me a cappucino was 1.35 euros - an hour later the other guy who took over his shift wanted 2euros for same - when i challenged him he dropped it to 1.50 with attitude !! Such a jerk - he was same guy who said hotel full so couldnt change rooms - chalk n cheese they were - glad one showed up the other ! but for the fact we only stayed 2 nights  we let it go but one thing's for sure - Barcelona Olympics are long gone and over and so is Hotel Canal Olimpic - never again will I spend my money there - a complete fail by all accounts! "
"11534","The premises looks run down. Everything very old.... "
"11535","No entertainment for 4 out of our 7 nights pool freezing cold good size though not even music around pool don't expect afternoon entertainment it did,nt happen"
"11536","great location. polite and helpful staff."
"11537","The rooms very comfortable and clean.  The bed memory foam mattress very comfortable and very comfortable pillows .  The food excellent every day   Staff were friendly and vey helpful ."
"11538","Very well located a few minutes walk from the city centre.  Price was very reasonable compared to similar hotels in the area and included breakfast and wifi.  Nice little bar downstairs that also sells snacks and Costa coffee.  Staff were polite."
"11539","Poo finger marks on the back of the toilet door that could have been cleaned off better.  Apart from that the room was adequately clean."
"11540","Clean and tidy.  The location is good with restaurants around.  "
"11541","The sound blockage is not really good enough, it is easily to listen the sound from corridor and room beside."
"11542","The guy receiving the guests at breakfeast remembered my room number the second day. The service in the restaurant was very friendly and professional."
"11543","The room was clean, situated in a very good location "
"11544","There was no warm water in the bathroom and so I had to have a cold shower in the morning which wasn't very pleasant and I would imagine will be even less pleasant in winter"
"11545","Hotel service on packed occasions is very bad !! Unfortunately staff made me late check in due to no availability of rooms once arrival, and didn't allow late check out once requested from them !! Room service and house keeping requires to call several times due to slowness !! Staff aren't welcoming at all and lack professionalism at work!!    Other than that facilities and room and location is great !!"
"11546","A very spacious 2 bedroomed apartment. Excellent cooking facilities. Much quieter than your average hotel room "
"11547","Great Room for the price. Go with the GO rooms, the extra amenities are worth the price. "
"11548","Cleaning could have been better. Hallways show wear and tear, but rooms are good. "
"11549","Good location. Quiet area.    A big well done to the cleaner that I asked for an electrical adaptor. If all the staff were like her then this hotel would score very highly indeed."
"11550","Some staff were quite indifferent to our needs. A request for the room safe to be opened was ignored. We were overcharged for my daughters breakfast. It inexplicably cost more for a Continental Breakfast for her than the previous nights Whole Sole dinner!"
"11551","Unfortunately this was one of the most expensive and worst places we stayed in on our Europe Trip. We scored bedroom number two on the bottom floor and immediately we could smell something bizarre to which as soon as we opened the bathroom, realised it was a mouldy kind of smell from the pipes/plumbing. The bed was fine...sleepable at night with the bathroom door closed but, because of the smell from the bathroom, we felt we couldn't stay at this hotel for longer than half an hour at a time. The staff weren't that accommodating...almost seemed like they knew themselves it wasn't great but they were getting the money for it so who cares?  Not sure if it's just a paris accommodation thing but we paid a lot less everywhere else in Europe for 3 star hotels and they were 5 star compared to this one! Hopefully for everyone else's sake we just scored a bad room and the rest of the hotel isn't like this!"
"11552","Room did not have a toilet brush. Insufficient vent in toilet area which was also on the small side. Upon request of a mattress topper 2 quilts were supplied as underlay. ( Uncomfortable mattress )  It helped a little. "
"11553","Hotel is strategically located opposite Fahrenheit  Mall and a short walking distance to Pavillion Mall and Starhill Gallery. Staff were very friendly and courteous."
"11554","Only stayed one night but overall experience good and will be revisiting again."
"11555","Good shuttle in free of charge.  Staff are helpful "
"11556","The air conditioner is hot, can only be 20 degree.  No change of shoes that during my living time."
"11557","Food was always cooked nicely in the restaurants (did not have buffet option).  Hotel staff were always pleasant and smiling, and were helpful.  Hotel is very clean.  Hotel is right on beach.  Always plenty of sunbeds at any time of day."
"11558","There are no negative reviews apart from room WiFi is a bit hit and miss when bad weather is around.."
"11559","Looks and feels great. Very modern. Staff great. Very impressed with Hotel. "
"11560","The breakfast, if you can call it that, was very poor. Not the only people to complain about it either on here or trip adviser. Proper hot full English or eggs is a must. Quality of food very poor. Warm milk for cereal, nice!.   Two days parking was £28. OK I know it's London etc but it's not central. Perhaps only charge when there is something on at the excell, that I could understand. "
"11561","Close to the center and old city"
"11562","parking for hotel residents 12 euro /night, poor breakfast"
"11563","Very nice hotel close to the main streets in Valletta.  Clean, quiet rooms."
"11564","The check in and check out procedures were onerous and time consuming."
"11565","Room was better than I expected after reading some reviews , friendly helpful staff would definitely stay here again ."
"11566","The only (small) cristique I have is that we called a day in advance to check in an hour eralier. While they said it was fine, when we  arrived there thery were still busy being cleaning our rooms and consequently the cleaners were rushed into finishing and missed a few spots. Very minor issue though, it was generally very clean."
"11567","Great location, near to the shops and Reading Terminal, well worth a visit. Staff friendly and helpful."
"11568","Excellent staff...very professional and helpful.  A dream hotel! "
"11569","VERY CLEAN , good value of money , nice location "
"11570","Very kind and helpful staff. Low budget hotel but value for money."
"11571","It lashed rain the whole evening but the underground parking worked a treat. Also it was a 1 minute walk to the lovely Yard restaurant that i had pre booked."
"11572","Great location"
"11573","This is an excellent hotel that we would recommend, the pool and bar facilities are very good. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment that was great, the bedrooms and living areas were very large and well presented. The kitchen also had everything needed for self catering including a good washing machine. There was no free cleaning service or fresh linen but this was no issue for a week. There are lots of places nearby to eat out and we found the whole area very reasonably priced. Top tips, pool towels are supplied for a 10 euro deposit each so there is no need to pack any. The supermarket in the hotel is full size and has everything you need at very good prices so there is no need to search round. "
"11574","Lovely staff.    Great privacy.   Everyone welcoming and helpful.     Good location"
"11575","Had to keep chasing around for toilet rolls and toiletries ."
"11576","Excellent value for money on our deal!! Very good location, Food excellent, Really helpful, friendly staff on reception and in restaurant. Excellent for access to Nec."
"11577","The only negatives were that our room was really warm, and being quite close to Birmingham Airport, we could hear planes coming in and taking off in the morning, but the windows were open due to the hot room."
"11578","Clean and welcoming. Close to the shops, restaurants and bars."
"11579","not really a negative about the hotel more York in general, poor parking facilities, plan ahead if you are taking a car ring the hotel a few weeks before and check availability of their carpark."
"11580","Good location, nice pool!"
"11581","Old construction. Room's need renovation."
"11582","Great experience,  Friendly, helpful staff"
"11583","Toilets and Showers were never cleaned and a disgrace."
"11584","New and modern style. Not far from main train station."
"11585","Counter staff is quite busy. Have been requested for more body wash for many times. Daily cleaning is not so clean."
"11586","Excellent value good location except walk to sky train is a nuisance"
"11587","good plain accomodation at a  reasonable price. Very conveniently situated."
"11588","the hotel service is not so good, even the towel had a dark spot on it. Also they should refine their bathroom component, the washstand looks like it will crash some time."
"11589","Nice hotel in good position as we were moved to jury's in on scottswood road the day before our check in"
"11590","We had problems when we got there has the hotel staff said the rooms which we had booked where not paid for already but they were and I then was told to prove this which it is a good job I had an email on my I phone are the hotel was not gonna let us check in"
"11591","The cleanliness was excellent. Staff very helpful, would stay again. Room facilities very good."
"11592","Besides no internet, it will be a great hotel. Good location and super huge room in term of value!"
"11593","Door cards reset twice during stay so had to go back to reception to get them enabled, again.  A chip under the desk (we didn't eat anything in the room).  Air conditioning made a constant hissing noise, but only had a thermostat with no actual off switch.  Only one lift worked, so at busy times lots of waiting around and it got full up quickly. Generally took the stairs from the fifth floor.  Bath drainage was broken, so it filled up 4-5 inches when someone showered. Whoever went in after had to stand in the water from the other person's shower."
"11594","Great nightly rate (through this site)  Modern Hotel  Nice swimming pool  Good Location"
"11595","Occasional foul drain smell in the bathroom  Cheap fixtures and fittings - towel rail came apart launching my wash bag into the loo  "
"11596","Many thanks to the receptionist who managed to find us a family room available earlier that the usual check-in time. This really was very much appreciated. As was the facility to leave luggage after checking out."
"11597","Good overall facilities and nice spacious room. Food and atmosphere excellent."
"11598","No tea or coffee making facilities in the room. Some things looking a little dated."
"11599","Had to ask for another room as the one we were given was unclean. Management were very helpful but the rooms were very basic and definitely not 4.5 stars. Our balcony area backed  a BBQ area and the pool area, luckily it was cold so no people at the pool but would hate to get this room in summer would be very noisy and there would be no privacy at all.  "
"11600","The hotel is very old and not too clean, rooms were better, but the hallways and elevators were distinctly unkept .  Washroom was ok, beds were old.  Food for the continental breakfast was stale and not many choices  Walls were thin, could hear the neighbor  Liked the size of the room and the fridge in the room.  The mechanism to unlock the room door was defective, however, staff was very pro active in getting it fixed."
"11601","Our family was really impressed with this hotel and will definitely book this hotel when in Montana the next time.  The staff was very friendly, accommodating and helpful!  From the staff to the front desk the lady in the breakfast room.  I would highly recommend this hotel to my family and friends. And my clients, as I am a travel agent from Calgary, AB, Canada.  "
"11602","Good view can see through whole Ipoh City"
"11603","Great location, beautiful surrounds and overall a lovely place to stay"
"11604","Had difficulty booking transfer to the hotel (which can only be accessed by boat) but all got sorted prior to us arriving  Pool needs some work - there are parts that are beautiful but others areas that need to be updated  Rooms arand facilities probably need some attention as well - mostly beautiful but there are some areas that let the resort down"
"11605","Great value for money and very comfortable."
"11606","The carpet had a substance spilled  it maybe nail varnish this could have been made to look better by simply placing a rug over the area. makes what is a very good hotel and room look shabby"
"11607","Friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast on the beach"
"11608","Nice and clean hotel. Very professional staff."
"11609","Location, facilities, ""feeling"""
"11610","Facilities very good, staff very helpful. Very handy for NEC"
"11611","First morning at breakfast total chaos. Seemed everyone turned up to eat at the same time. No clean glasses, cups or dishes available to get your breakfast! Second morning was better."
"11612","Will definitely return and recommend to friends."
"11613","better than I have expected"
"11614","Fantastic hotel and great location for a night out in newcastle"
"11615","Overall the apartment was very good."
"11616","Housekeeping department can do a better job in terms of the room cleanliness."
"11617","The hotel was excellent value for money, perfect location in proximity to Disneyland and tours."
"11618","great place,great location, would stay here again. ;-))"
"11619","Nice aparment, easy check-in , well everything was allright."
"11620","The overall stay was very good, would definately return, staff very friendly, very clean, stayed on half board basis, evening meal very good and breakfast excellent. men played golf  and enjoyed their game but a very hilly course."
"11621","We had a very incompetent waiter serving us on saturday night, firstly our order was taken, we waited ages to be told that the order had gone missing so we ordered again, we asked for drinks, waited ages, asked for water twice, bread twice because of the wait, starter and mains arrived, was very good, asked if we wanted to see desert menu, never arrived, had to prompt him again,waited 20 mins for deserts, hardly anyone in the restaurant by this time, it eventually arrived, we had to keep asking other waitress's for service, which we did find very efficient, don't know what his name was but obviously this job is not for him or he needs some training, which is a shame if some training could help as he did seem enthusiastic but just wasn't with it on the night."
"11622","Well worth the money you pay for it. Excellent location and clean and comfortable.  Would definitely recommend. I can't comment on the food as we didn't eat breakfast."
"11623","The Windsor is The Windsor - it is a Melbourne icon. The staff are exceptional and the decor is beautiful."
"11624","We found the room very disappointing - bathroom was small and the bath was chipped.  Room rate included breakfast buffet which turned out to be continental only.  The range of food was poor and when we arrived at around 9am alot of the food had gone.  For the money I would go somewhere else."
"11625","Great value for money, really clean "
"11626","The Wi-Fi didn't work in the rooms."
"11627","This is a great hotel for a stopover. Staff are very professional and friendly and the room is perfect for a short stay. "
"11628","The check in was easy....we were earlier than the 4PM checkin and the room was ""not ready"" so we had to kill time before being able to check in just before 4PM. The unit was clean, pleasant, and had very nice up to date furnishings. It was a studio unit, bedroom and kitchenette area and a living room area with pull out couch that had a pull out room divider if you had another couple staying with you. Allows for privacy. Very comfortable. The staff were pleasant and professional."
"11629","The only negative I would say was the placement of the unit. We only stayed one night because we came in a day early for our timeshare unit. But the unit did not face the water, it faced the street and a restaurant. OK for one night, but if I was staying for the week, I would have been disappointed."
"11630","Good Hotel nice location and very helpful staff"
"11631","Was given a top floor room as I had asked. Smallish room but a fantastic corner balcony which seemed to be twice the size of those on the floors below. Hotel away from the noise of town centre but in a good position to access most part of town and the 2 beaches. Bit of a climb thought!"
"11632","Some of the staff need to remember to ""smile"" a little more."
"11633","staff very friendly and helpful try their best at all times"
"11634","food ok but very limited menue"
"11635","We have stayed at this hotel quite regularly.  Its location is very convenient and the rooms are clean.  With the complimentary buffet breakfast it is value for money.  Will surely return to stay at this hotel the next time I travel to Kuala Lumpur."
"11636","very close to most significance and interesting places ,  Piccadilly line is very close   the stuff are very friendly , wi-fi is free we recommend it as a good one"
"11637","Good views of the river if not a little Industrial.  Staff very quick to attend rooms.  All Restaurant staff very professional.  Distinct lack of children....yeah."
"11638","Wi-Fi listed as free like every other Hotel in Bangkok....NOT TRUE !!!   400THB (USD$12.00) per half hour    RIP-OFF!  we were told because the booking was through an agent (Hotelopia) it did not qualify for free WiFi (what Bullsh*t)  River Dinner Cruise not available.  Air Conditioner in room stuck on 26 Deg.   Shower screen leaks badly, leaving large puddle in door . Very dangerous!  Vin Nam outdoor riverside Bar-B-Que no longer on offer.  All guests seem to use the Hotel for sleeping only, leaving the 4 very nice restaurants empty and with no atmosphere each and every night of our 7 day stay.   One gets the impression the Hotel has seen better days and is on the  out.  Penny pinching is not the  to build clientele, sorry guys."
"11639","Booked this hotel 10 days before travelling, and was surprised at the low price, didn't know what to expect.  Very pleasantly surprised, lovely hotel, recently refurbished and good quality furniture and fittings in room, better than the hilton at York, which was 5 x the price!! Efficient check in,courteous staff. A comfortable nights sleep, and the breakfast was delicious.Would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
"11640","The only negative comment about this hotel is it's close proximity to the train station and the station announcements are very loud and can be heard from the bedrooms ( at the back) and seemed to start at 6am?! "
"11641","Clean, tidy and quiet"
"11642","Not so much smiling and helpful"
"11643","Clean, nice hotel with good breakfast. All public transport very close by.  Best ratio price/quality in town.  Gym   sauna available in the price"
"11644","Everything was great service food and location was perfect for things to do looking forward to returning soon"
"11645","The new hotel was nice but next time I might try the classic hotel side.  This one was very modern with less Havana character.  Also I get up very early 4-5am and it seems that the hot water was off during the early morning hours.  Overall the pool and dining area and accomodations were very nice.  "
"11646","The staff was wonderful.  Unfortunately, my wife fell and broke her arm on the second day.  They were extremely helpful with many details, for example, reading the instructions for her medicine in Italian and translating for us.  I would rate them a10!!!"
"11647","Hotel was relatively clean, tidy with a good range of food on offer. Staff friendly but nothing wow about the place!"
"11648","The staff were amazing "

"11655","breakfast service was a bit hit and miss, we didn't have it included in our rate so tried it only once!"
"11656","Very friendly helpful staff. Great location for walking to lots of interesting places and close to the U-Bahn as well.   Plenty of restaurants within walking distance."
"11657","Great hotel staff and management at the hotel    Board racks under the bar to keep your boards out of the sun "
"11658","Very friendly staff. Excellent facilities. Rooms are very quiet despite the central location.  "
"11659","Rooms are large and has a minibar which might be handy for late arriving person if you dont want to go down to main building."
"11660","Staff attitude is typical for a big hotel ""We are here to help you"" which translates to be ""could not care less"". Registration staff is not capable to solve any problems. I also asked a room facing the quiet side and got a room facing pool - and the noisy pool maintenance was done till 1am. Registration also failed to check in me to the correct room type i had booked. Location is off Strip and it really means OFF.. so be aware when booking."
"11661","The fitness-studio should be opened many more hours."
"11662","The hotel is very clean and even though in a busy area of the city the rooms are quiet. The staff are friendly and helpful even when the unexpected happens, we woke up to no water on the Monday morning due to a Severn Trent problem but bottles of drinking water were provided and rooms for showers were provided in their sister hotel over the road."
"11663","Not really a negative but since I stayed here last year the lifts seem to take a long time to arrive when called, this wasn't a problem last year so not sure if they have changed something."
"11664"," No service at all.and this hotel I dont give more then one star."
"11665","We had a refurbished room which was excellent.  The food was very good. The whole complex was very clean."
"11666","Too many cats in the complex."
"11667","The location of the hotel is good within the golden triangle and walkable to the sights such as the petronas towers and china town . The pool roof top looks nice with a bar although we didn't have time to swim in it.   "
"11668","This certainly isn't a 5 star as suggested on arrival we carried our own luggage up the ramps and to the room. The room although was large smelt like stale cigarettes .   The breakfast is pleasant but also not a 5 star rating as suggested.   "
"11669","Very comfortable beds.  Very clean, Bar prices are reasonable.  Location is superb.   Service was good.  Staff very friendly.  Good choice and quality of food at breakfast except for Orange juice which was watered down."
"11670","Exorbitant WIFI.  £10 per day.  .   Watered down Orange Juice at breakfast, noise from lifts.  Car Park v expensive although they reduced it to £7 per day as we were staying for 3 days"
"11671","Compliments to the chef...the spa balcony rooms looked amazing and would book next time."
"11672","Very nice hotel, our room was very clean and comfortable, with a nice big TV. The toilet was extremely clean and pleasant, thank you for that. Breakfast was included in our stay which was lovely and filled up our tummies nicely before leaving. All in all, nothing out of the ordinary, but a big plus for the cleanliness of the rooms! Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. The location is also very nice, not in city center exactly but restaurants and shops can be found in the nearby shopping center or by just walking for approx. 1 km. Great bus connections to other parts of town as well. What I also liked was that it wasn't a big hotel and not a small one, but just the perfect size to keep a comfortable atmosphere, almost as if it wasn't a part of a big chain of hotels."
"11673","cheap and close to the airport with a shuttle bus every hour,would not stay more than one night,the staff try their best(i think)"

Five of us from Perth arrived in late at 2am in the morning and the reception waited to greet us and show us our rooms. 24/7 service and great value for money,  to go Adi Dharma. "
"11715","Location great, near metro stations, British Museum, shopping center etc. Easy to reach the city centrum. Tranquil neighbourhood. Frienly staff. Luggage room.  The room was renovated and clean but old. "

"11722","The hotel`s location is excellent; shops, restaurants and the beach are in walking distance. For the price Kaiser is excellent value. All the staff was very friendly, service-minded and helpful. My room was clean, air-conditioned, had good bathroom, comfortable beds, nice balcony and a wonderful view to the sea. I really enjoyed my visit and will be back there soon."
"11723","car parking inadequate  staff disinterested  heavily overpriced"
"11724","You cant beat the value at this hotel. Nothing compares to its price/quality ratio. I happened to be there the day of the recent 7.2 earthquake.   There was a little lack of supervision from the staff during this emergency. I would have expected  more direction / announcements  dealing with guests during a disaster like this. I packed my things and escaped down a stair well into a garage an outside with no one leading the  out. A little supervision during this time would have been appreciated though I suspect many hotels dealt with similar issues this day. They were, however, back online with power in the hotel  within 15 minutes after the initial shock. All in all it worked out.     Alpa City Suites remains a grand value in Cebu."
"11725","A disaster recovery plan is needed to help direct guests during emergencies."

"11727","Beautiful grounds and views and pool areas."
"11728","No aircondition"
"11729","There is not dry staling for hear. It is very important for woman."
"11730","The room itself was spacious and clean, very close to Wembley arena which I wanted, did not eat there but think they do a 3 course meal for £14.95 all in, only bought a vodka and coke for £4.85!!"
"11731","The house keeping was excellent - room very well cleaned with fresh towels"
"11732","Not enough dessert variety for vegans apart from ice cream"
"11733","Beautiful position right on the best part of chaweng beach.  Staff at pool and beach very good.   All staff very friendly.  Music by dj Paulo is excellent.  Spacious room and balcony with good views."
"11734","Breakfast not great choice and although the staff very friendly you do have to ask for everything including coffee as nobody came and asked."
"11735","The proximity to the beach, center, restaurants, shopping, and night life was excellent. The hotel was ok overall, room was decent with nice, clean interior.I was very happy with the balcony and the sea view from it. "
"11736","Where do I start? On my first night there was a rain storm. My room was on the top floor and it started leaking rain water directly above my bed. I asked to be moved to another room. The night receptionist said hotel was booked up. As a result I spent the whole night in the lobby only to find out at 6am that they had had a room all along available on another floor. In my opinion, staff were either totally indifferent to customers' problems or they did not comprehend English enough - they always smiled and pretended they had understood when in fact, I am certain, they did not. Other issues were: Sheets and covers were never changed during my whole stay of 1 week; WiFi connection in the room was almost non-existent - either poor or not working at all; The size of the pool was infinitely small- more like a dipping pool rather than a swimming pool; Food was not varied; There was no shampoo in the bathroom, which is unusual for a 4 star property; It is true that the all-inclusive rate was very low but it all came with the above 'extras'. "
"11737","New, close to airport.  Free parking.  Very friendly and proactive concierge.  Tried their best to arrange early check in."
"11738","Far from city centre.  Small room.  Poor room arrangement - not offered adjoining rooms, preferred views even requested.  "
"11739","Receptionist when available were very helpful."

"11742","The location is good and friendly staff,and i like the Garden,when you get up in the morning,you can see many birds in front of your room."
"11743","There is much ant in the room..  "
"11744","No brochure telling the rules of the room: when the cleaning team comes, where should the towels be left for changing (as we left hanging on a chair, dirty towel was not changed). Some distance to the sea and not easy to walk if a person is old: a sandy hill to walk down.  As we had ""studio""- the plates were not very clean in the shelves and they were dusty"
"11745","Hotel is simple and clean, staffs are helpful, good value for money."
"11746","I feel most people would be happy with a simple breakfast of fried noodles,fried rice, toasts, hot /cold drinks and some local fruits. The milk was diluted and food did not look like food except for hard boiled eggs."
"11747","Hotel is situated, close to the C.B.D., and is within walking distance."
"11748","Rooms extremely small. I had a view of three concrete structures. Some of my bed linen had stains on it and I found hairs on some of the bed linen. The mattress of the bed was very old and sank in the middle causing a severe backache!  There was no porter's in service or assistance leaving me to navigate and negotiate my baggage to my room. This was difficult as I have a disability.  Finally I was told. Upon check out, and in a loud voice for all to hear, that I would not receive my bond until my room was checked for any damages! I felt like a messy teenager."
"11749","clean bedding  and good tourist location"
"11750","I have booked 2 bed  room with the shower and toilet  but when arrived i was told i will get a 6 berth prison cell and the shower was not working - although I have been told the problem with the shower was reported the day ealier , I had to change the room for another  6 berth  cell and guess what the room next to me was the one which I have booked   and empty - 2 proper beds. No explanation was given why i wasn't offered that room in the first place - the whole issue is I had undergone  a neurosurgical  operation on my back and cannot get to bank bed, I have only made reservation on-line after seeing the photos of  the  2-bed room - otherwise I would book  another hostel- why there is no mention to begin with that the 2 room beds are only serving as the bites for the tourists ? when you actually arrive then you have to take what is there  and believe in the receptionist's stories that all the room were already taken - then it means there were actually overbooking  and wehen I was placing my reservation on line there was a message saying there a 2 twinn bed rooms left , so please please, make sure from the beggining of your arrival at this hostel you are getting what you have paid for."

"11756","Public areas were very smart and the staff were very friendly , helpful and polite."
"11757","The bedroom didn't resemble the photo on the website and was particularly dirty. The bed sheets looked very clean though the carpet was so filthy that we didn't want to walk barefoot. The decor was old and tired with dirty wallpaper and holes in the walls where fixtures had been removed. During the following morning my wife and I discovered plenty of bites over our bodies.    The breakfast was also a bit limited.    Shame really as the hotel has lots of promise but would never stay there again."
"11758","Well located with seaview.  Good WIFI in the lobby.  Delicious mails.  Clean rooms.  A good place to start and/or to finisch a holliday in Turkiye"
"11759","Close to the Disney parcs, nice room, great breakfast"
"11760","The first morning we had to wait more than 30 minutes before we could have breakfast because only 1 of the breakfastrooms was open. Luckily the second room was also open the other mornings."
"11761","near the beach and centrum"
"11762","We did not get any other hotel and since pictures of the rooms were not bad, we chose this place. But in reality it was not like the pictures wanted us to imagine. The room was not clean and the beds were terrible. I got a back ache. I saw staff only once during my stay. We had paid for five nights, but stayed only four. I will never choose this hotel again."
"11763","Well situated, very good facility, good food and service. "

"11765","We arrived very early "
"11766","Staff at reception very pleasant and efficient. ease of access by car especially when leaving is perfect."
"11767","Booking on line should be improved.  Does not give you the cheapest price and does not allow for Senior discounts."
"11768","The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was ok, pool was clean, nice ladies by the pool to give you a massage at really reasonable prices! The location is good and not too far from the beach."
"11769","The shower temperature - burning hot or cold! "
"11770","Excellent service and nicely decked out hotel. Very clean and a nice touch to have a complimentary mini bar"

"11772","situation in the city : excellent in the neighbourt of busses, taxis, walk facilities to places of interest  breakfast excellent  silent rooms and god beds"
"11773","The roof top bar was giood with lovely views of the city.  The staff all spoke English well which was useful."
"11774","None of the taxis knew where it was.  This made it difficult at night as the roads are very dark"
"11775","The hotel is in an excellent location for exploring Alicante. I've stayed here twice this year and each time the hotel has been spotlessly clean. Great value for money."
"11776","No Taxi queue around hotel.  Most Taxi drivers do not know the hotel location.  Noise from the door close/open all night.  No restaurant.  No glass to drink water in room."

"11781","Beautiful hotel, stunning roof garden, cosy lounge, excellent customer service, delicious breakfast! Will definately be returning!"
"11782","A guest accidentally set off the emergency alarm at 7am, which was an unexpected wake-up call! Of course, this is of no fault of the hotel or its staff, although while trying to find an emergency exit, there was no staff around who could of helped us. We understand that there is very few staff on duty at this time, however it would have been reassuring to see a member of staff when we weren't sure what was happening! The alarm was quite scary with instantaneous images of the place burning down (which it didn't of course!) but apart from this, a very positive experience. "
"11783","clean room, nice quiet part of the town."
"11784","noisy music outside"
"11785","Great location and polite, porfessional service.  Excellent facilities.  Great selection of food at breakfast.  Very good bar service and food."
"11786","The first room offered, although non-smoking, smelt strongly of stale tobacco.  Room was changed."
"11787","We booked another hotel with same name and facilities near centre. So were mdisarusfied before we went. Woukdnot trust or book with Hotelopia again. We were misled and missold and when we phoned to try to rectify sitaution were told very oatronisingly by hotelopia staff that its very easy for people to make mistakes when booking on the internet. I book 3 to 5 trips a year using internet and this is the first time i used hotelopia and ghe first time i had a problem.     This hotel was ok but too far away, too remote and no staff for information. A setious minus.quality of the apartments themselves was ok but we wouldnt go there again or recommend it to others."
"11788","Beautiful, old interior. Very helpful personnel. Later noticed doublepayment was solved quickly. I`ll be back."
"11789","This hotel is all about location! Fantastic access to Universal Studios, within walking distance "
"11790","Nothing to say that is negative... Possibly the only 'niggle' was not always having English breakfast tea replaced in the room daily... Camomile kept popping up!! But after a call to reception "
"11791","Very central to all the sight seeing at Athens. Renovated rooms are clean and well maintained. Free WiFi and pretty fast for all your communication and uploading of photos. Airport bus is just a 5 minutes walk up the road and cost €5 and takes 50-60 minutes."
"11792","Very limited choice of breakfast food given. Bacon is not crisp which I really hates.  Bathroom is a bit small with no room to put your toiletries."
"11793","Fantastically equipped apartment with ample parking and access to hotel facilities. Easy access from Faro"
"11794","Pool very small, area around apartments a bit run down."
"11795","The location is great, there's a cheap bar like in? or atleast next to the hotel which servers 0,5L beer for just over an euro (27 ck). Within 10 minutes walking you'll be in the 'real' center where drinks will quickly rise up to approx 3 euro's. So if you're gonna chill here with your mates you can have some good 'pre-drinking' unfortunately I was with my girlfriend so I had to behave ;P The staff is friendly, I think most of the visitors come here with AAA taxi cabs from the airport. This hotel will NOT call AAA Cabs for you when you leave because their manager has some deals with other taxi company. This is no problem since you can just walk outside the street and pick up your AAA Taxi (and hand them over your 47% discount voucher)    While some hotels make a problem if you bring 'guests' in your room, I highly doubt they will even know who your entire group is. Since the staff changes quite frequently. So if you're out clubbing and wanna bring someone along big chance it will not be any problem.    You can reach all sightseeing things here by foot, the clock, bridge, castle etc. We requested a room on a higher floor which we also got (we got a room on topfloor) thats because we heard you can hear alot of noise from the streets. This wasn't too bad from our room to be honest..you just hear ALOT of police (not during nighttime tho strangely enough)    They will guard your luggage in a special locked room the day you leave and have to check out."
"11796","The included breakfast isn't really worth getting up for, I believe breakfast is served from 7-10am. We went about 9...  Breadroaster didn't really work, eggs were cold, bread was dry... your better off just having some extra rest and paying for a decent breakfast in the city somewhere...unless you are really tight in your budget of course :)    There is no refrigerator/mini bar..you can call them for some snacks which you can check out in the lobby.     Beds aren't thát great but great chances you'll be so tired from all the walking you'll fall asleep quickly anyway    The minuses mentioned above here had little value to me...so if you think you can sleep on an 'okay' bed...and afford good breakfast elsewhere and cope without a minibar. Don't let these things hold you back. For me it was just an alright place to stay during the night."
"11797","Friendly staff, great location, tasty food"
"11798","Need bigger bath towels, wider tv channel selection, better lighting in corridors, hair dryers with longer cords - cord too short to stand in front of mirror"
"11799","Poor very little room with broken equipment . Overall a 3 star Hotel with beautiful location.  "
"11800","Staff was very friendly, and spoke english. Breakfast was allright.  Working airconditioning in the rooms and enough space to place our bags."
"11801","Sheets and towels were smelly and not clean. Rooms weren't cleaned during our stay and beds weren't made. The streets around the hotel are very dirty and buildings are in bad condition."
"11802","A good location ,besides,breakfasf tases well ,it is convenience for us to look around the city."
"11803","Close to the beach spacious and clean apartments would go back again"
"11804","improve the air"
"11805","Fabulous Hotel in very beautiful, unique location complete with wonderful staff and service"
"11806","Nice room. Very comfy double bed. Lots of desk space. Double wardrobe. An iron, ironing board and trouser press attached to the wall was very handy. Bathroom very nice.  Shower gel provided, no shampoo, so had to use as both which was fine I guess. The inclusive gym was very handy. Lobby nice. Restaurant nice, small portions but well presented and delicious. Breakfast was great. Bar is good. "
"11807","Shower kept randomly turning very hot unfortunately, received no response to the service form I left. Gym is small, fits up to 6 people, but it's not used much so I always had a space when I went in the evening; could do with more mirrors to make it look better and air con."
"11808","We had a Great experience during our visit and will definitely stay there again.  The staff was very courteous and attentive.  The hotel was very clean and the room design was wonderful!"
"11809","None really."
"11810","Hotelopia got booking wrong and we had a double bed room, the hotel sorted us out immediately wit a twin bed room which is what we had booked.  Staff were all friendly and helpful."
"11811","Great location buses 450mt  banks sercurity great staff went out there  I got hand written messages passed on from my aunty the cleaning staff asked any special needs"
"11812","Smoking in their coffee room speeds in to the eating area bearable"
"11813","Our room was on the -st floor of the Bauer Casa nova . It was in itself nice and spacious, but so dark we needed all the lights on even when the sun was shining .We arrived to the hotel in the evening, and were given a room on the 1st floor and there was no view in the Casa Nova building, we told of our concern about darkness but the receptionist appeased us by saying there were 4 windows.  Well there could have been more windows it would have changed nothing to the fact this room was Dark and gloomy and gave on to a wall ."
"11814","This hotel was an awesome value, and a SUPERB location. I would definitely stay here again! Room size and mattress comfort where good!  "
"11815","rooms needs to improve"
"11816","Lovely ancient building good basic breakfast"
"11817","Bed very hard , towels dreadful , sheets and towels not changed in 4 night stay , only 2 towels"
"11818","The breakfast needs some more stuff ,vegetables and fruits"
"11819","Good food at The Island hotel"
"11820","Nice and neat hotel with all that you need for a weekend in Melbourne. Value for money and great location. Staff were helpful with some printing needs and general information"
"11821","Quiet inside... pools.lovely..  ...restaurant well managed...variety of food very good .  Music in disco finished about 10 .30 pm .Staff  polite and worked hard.Problem with shower dealt with immediately."
"11822","T.V. not working ,(No problem for us )..electric socket by dressing table too low so could not plug  our equipment in there..There were 2 others though  Only one of four lifts working whilst we were there.Our room 3007 in La Valette was too near the ""disco room/bar""so could hear the music at night.As senior citizens would have preferred a room further away normally.. though  as no music after 10.30 pm.ish   didn't need to ask to be moved tho' I believe  it would not have been a problem if requested."
"11823","Excellent breaksfast; good shuttle from/to the terminal/rail station"
"11824","Cliing it an airport hotel when it is situated in the cargo areasime miles away seems too much"
"11825","The Hotel Algarve is generally a lovely hotel, very clean and the breakfasts are excellent!  The pool is massive and being able to walk down to the beach easily is a bonus.  The Sunset Bar is well worth a visit to catch the daily sunsets which can be stunning and the bar staff are all very friendly and welcoming.  "
"11826","My only negative comment would be that some of the reception and restaurant staff can be rather brusque at times and could do a bit more to make guests feel welcome.  "
"11827","These guys made incredible job by turning the villa into hotel, every detail has been worked on. Very clean and very comfortable. The beds are little bit hard."
"11828","Staff is very impolite, even rude. The cleaning lady openly asked for the tip (she called it ""present for me""), and insisted on it several times, even forcing herself into the room while we were there in order to receive it.  The man on the entrance is also trying to get the tip, or to organise you the taxi 100% over the price in the street, and when we declined, he charged us extra money for keeping our luggage in the hotel room until our flight."
"11829","Very luxury hotel, very good value for money. Nice gardens, nice lakes, nice beach. Good meals. They even serve more expensive drinks on the the bars on the pool and hotel (not on the beach though).  The beach is clean."
"11830","Nothing really. They gave us curtesy room to take a shower while waiting for the flight - with no towels/soap in it, however.  If you are trying to get information about the connections to Havana, trips etc, it is a maze, staff is not really adequate.  "
"11831","Very nice little ""jungle"" of the gardens. Bungalows are good, very nice idea. Gardens are well kept. Room is nice."
"11832","Curtesy room while waiting for the flight.  Nice beach."
"11833","Beach is not really private. Alcohol is of the lowest level. Bad food. We have been to better hotels in Cuba for the same money."
"11834","Very big room. Nice view form high floors. Very good breakfast."
"11835","Good Location, Relaxing"
"11836","Resort needs an Upgrade / Maintenance  Buffet Food average  Golf Course in Poor Condition"
"11837","Staff was great,nice clean rooms,great breakfast and close to highway and walking distance to Old Town. We would definitely stay there again!"
"11838","Very warm welcome, staff most helpful. Stayed in the boat house, very cute, nice room. Lovely food."
"11839","The hotel room we stayed in was large, nice and clean, bathroom well equipped with towels, bathrobes incl etc.  Breakfast was excellent buffet, everything very fresh, we have stayed in this hotel before and we will be back again, it is one of the best in KK. Excellent location to centre of everything."
"11840","Staff could not communicate in basic English.  When asked for assistance, they will reply they do not understand or read English.  We have them to check our departure terminal, they gave us wrong terminal and told the cab driver so, caused us to nearly miss our flight!"
"11841","Nothing was to much trouble for the staff. some real positives was the availability of a drop off service, The best was that on the day we checked out there was no one checking in so they allowed us to make use of the Villa for the day at no additional cost, "
"11842","nothing Negative"
"11843","Well located hotel with friendly staff. Good value for money. "
"11844","Although booked and paid for room for 6 nights it was not available on first night. Sent to another hotel which was of inferior quality. "
"11845","Room was shabby  Shower was dangerous as the water didn't drain away - no cubicle and no sloping floor. The bathroom had disability access but was badly designed.  The room was not worth the cost - particularly with the additional car parking cost."
"11846","very central to all amenities"
"11847","Great location, beautiful grounds, polite service staff"
"11848","The rooms are in need of repair, especially flooring and lighting"
"11849","friendly staff, right on the beach"
"11850","We were made to feel really welcome by a helpful receptionist"
"11851","I was in a room near to a door that seemed to bang all night and the mattress was very soft.  my friend also commented on the softness of the mattress"
"11852","Really small "
"11853","The quality of the hotel for the price is second to none. Location, room and breakfast were all superb. Have paid 3 times the price in the past for hotels not nearly as good."
"11854","Very good sized rooms with fridge kettle and hotplate.  Family room took three beds and a cot and still had room to move around. There was also a separate lounge with kitchenette, table and chairs, settee and two arm chairs.  Breakfast was very enjoyable with plenty of choice for adults and children.  Nice swimming pool and children's pool and a small play area.  Staff happy to order taxi's and offer advice about places to visit.  Excellent location for beaches and restaurants in easy walking distance."
"11855","You can get wet going to breakfast if it is raining."
"11856","We have stayed at this hotel 5 times. The decor is a little dated but it is quiet and clean and comfortable with large air-conditioned rooms with patio doors and balconies looking  the mountains and/or pool. The ground floor rooms lead directly  the pool via gated fences. The rooms all have fridges and microwaves, the breakfast (usually included in the room rate) is substantial and varied with home baking. The pool is a good size with lots of loungers and chairs and tables and is open until quite late in the evening along with the jacuzzi. The hotel is at the Indian Canyon end of Palm Springs so a good 1 1/2 miles (40 mins walk) to the centre of Palm Springs (there is a regular bus service) but there are places to eat locally too. It has a small laundry and gym too and free wi-fi. There is always lots of parking available in the shade. Basically we feel you get a lot for the low price that we have always paid. The staff are very friendly and helpful which is one of the reasons we have returned so many times."
"11857","The hotel was very basic but clean and perfectly habitable.  The staff were friendly. Fridge in the room...  I'm clutching at straws here!"
"11858","The pool was constantly in the shade of the hotel so was rarely used by anyone, other than the stray cats!  The room was very basic but perfectly clean and habitable, we were given twin beds instead of the double we booked, we were offered a different room with a double but it wasn't up to scratch.  The 4* rating is a bit of a joke really, it was in need of renovation.  No jaccuzzi as advertised and the sauna cost extra."
"11859","Room very old , staff no any service. The breakfast buffet is rubbish."
"11860","Good location downtown Brussels"
"11861","Room service left the window wide open and my room was in the ground floor, I was out all day and someone could easily have climbed into my room from the outside."
"11862","Booked a last minute deal at a reasonable price.  Room only and we ate out for all meals as we prefer using local eateries.  We had a very good stay at the Excelsior. The location, pools and Gym facilities are very good.  We paid to upgrade our room to one with a balcony. The room was identical and the upgrade a bit pricey but we thought it worthwhile. "
"11863","The pool restaurant/bar is closed in the evenings so there's no outdoor dining/drinking area."
"11864","We enjoy the stay, like the surrounding of animals. "
"11865","Our opinion of the price of beverages and food, are to high and expensive for the average South African. Feeling is that there are only catered for the international tourist."
"11866","Breakfast was good,plenty of choice.friendly staff,good location"
"11867","lighting is poor, made the hotel seem dull,even in the rooms, small car park"
"11868","Everything seemed to be fine until the moment when everyone were moved to another hotel! Hotel staff told us that hotel is almost empty (200  people) and the owner decided to close it and move everyone to another hotel without even asking.  "
"11869","Check in - very  efficient, we were shown to the apartment and all the facilities in the apartment were checked and explained. Staff very helpful.  Apartment - fantastic, luxury, spacious, fabulous view over the marina. Late check out available for a small fee.  Security - outstanding, fully staffed 24 hours with security gates. Safe in room.  Location - excellent, quiet part of the marina yet only 5 minutes walk to the heart of the V"
"11870","Location is very good"
"11871","Hotel for a long time, you need to renovated bathrooms in particular"
"11872","Very good! The hotel is situated close to the Bodrum center and Gumbet. It's clean, well runned and relaxing."
"11873","- SPA  - Animations day and night  - Food"
"11874","Great Position, food good for the star rating and rooms clean, good value for money"
"11875","Rooms small and walls as thick as paper"
"11876","good location"
"11877","small rooms  terrible breakfast overpriced"
"11878","Staff were extremely polite and helpful. Room was spotlessly clean. Free and large carpark with a subway station just a five minute walk away to take you into the city centre"
"11879","Travelling with friends for a 3 day city break, hotel's location to the main station is ideal for travelling and only 10mins walk to centre. Lots of eating places close by. "
"11880","beautiful classy hotel, great swimmingpool area.  Excellent friendly staff.  Buffet is very good"
"11881","We have stayed here twice now. Both times towards the end of October because we were running The Mallorca Marathon. This hotel is great, a real nice place to stay and quite cheap at this time of year. The location is stunning, especially if you get a sea view. We will more than likely stay there again, depending on price?"
"11882","I heard some rumours that the hotel has a bit of a bad rep, due to being close to the Magaluf Strip? Maybe it is quite lively in peak season? I was also told that next year it is supposed to be a family only hotel? Lastly the hotel is up a steep hill! Did not bother us, as we were there to run the Marathon. Could hear noise from the other rooms when we were trying to sleep."
"11883","Comfortable overnight stay in an attractive sea-side resort"
"11884","The hotel was very clean. The amenities were very well taken care of. Lifeguards were on duty during the pool opening hours. The cabaret in the moonlight bar was of a high standard. The housekeeping service was excellent. I would definitely return."
"11885","The only negative aspect was the noise - due to the structure of the building, the night time noise carries further - eg. parties on the 7th floor were very audible to those on the 1st floor. We were offered an alternative room, but it was my choice to decline as I didn't want to move all our belongings. Staff were very sympathetic and understanding when I complained."
"11886","Staff were the best - very helpful and friendly."
"11887","No tea or coffee making equipment in the room which was different to the last time we stayed but not informed of this until we entered the room.The bus to the park were not as frequent as advertised and took over an hour on the first day to catch one after that we paid the money and used the car."
"11888","Has all the facilities you will need excellent kitchen breakfast bar . Beds were very comfortable . Local 24 hr store next to hotel . You can can use the beach area of the hotel across the road and tikki bar . Swimming pool was great open till 10 pm . Staff very friendly And helpful we will definitely be staying here again when we return next time . "
"11889","It's about a 15  min walk to the main shopping and resturant area but taxis do run a 5 dollar service anywhere on the front . "
"11890","Convenient location for a stop-over before an early morning/late night flight from KLIA or LCCT.  Free scheduled shuttle from KLIA.  Onsite restaurants with a good choice of dining options.  Limited but adequate buffet breakfast was available before 5:00AM.The full buffet breakfast being prepared looked impressive.  Free internet was available."
"11891","No Free shuttle from/to LCCT.  Limited free scheduled shuttle from/to KLIA.  Early morning/Very late night airport transfer can only be made via the comparatively expensive Hotel mini bus (there was a distinct lack of external Taxis - which would have been dearer in any case).  Isolated location from any major shopping/food center."
"11892","Excellent location, breakfast substantial and varied. Rooms clean and a good size."
"11893","Hotel had not booked the correct number of rooms but this was resolved after a while. Make sure you take a confirmation of your booking as it was only after we showed this that they admitted their mistake. Room key card only worked occasionally and had to be reset every day with no explanation or apology. We were accused of keeping the key card  next to a mobile phone which was not the case as we did not take the phone out with us and purposely kept it separate from anything else. We also paid for the 12.80 zloty city tax with a 50 zloty note but only received 7.20 in change. This may have been a genuine mistake but worth checking your change before leaving."
"11894","NEED TO PAY CAR PARKING, NEED TO PAY FOR INTERNET, BREAKFAST NOT ON THE 4* LEVEL... This was a previous IBEROSTAR hotel and previous it has a really great service, I would say that this hotel is more a 3* than a 4*."
"11895","Very friendly and courteous staff.  Great location in downtown Kobe in Sannomiya, right in the heart of everything!"
"11896","The shower is quite small; barely enough room to even turn around, but there is great water pressure so it's possible to take a relaxing shower."
"11897","This is a very beautiful resort and it was a pleasure to stay in."
"11898","The building, lobby area and grounds are quite grand and have so much history to them.  The views of the sea and Malecon from the outside bar terrace are amazing.  There is a free mini museum near the outside bar terrace that explains the Cuban Middle crisis.  The staff were generally friendly.  Tour desk and currency exchange desk in hotel lobby were useful to have.  "
"11899","No hot water for some of our showers.  Charge of 25CUCs each for any meals - buffet dinner was appalling and they don't let you charge to room.  Room was dirty, smelly and despite asking for the towels to be changed, they had just been hung back up on the towel racks and turned around (we had tipped housekeeping 3CUCS so extra disappointing).  Internet at $10 USD per hour is ridiculous for a supposedly 5star hotel.  Although they have a gym, it wasn't made clear at any point that you have to pay 5CUCs per person per visit and they don't even have complimentary water in the gym let alone in the rooms.  "
"11900","Every single member of staff made us feel very welcome.  Absolutely fantastic with our dog.  Great walks from the grounds of the hotel.  Superb food in the Abbey Bistro.  Thank you for a brilliant stay."
"11901","Can't think of anything...  We will definitely be back."
"11902","It is near the lake, the swimming pool and wellness area are great. Every room has it's own balcony."
"11903","Quite loud because of poor building materials."
"11904"," The stains on the wall  should have been clean, room generally quite clean"
"11905","It's a very good value for money hotel in a nice neighbourhood in the Medina. The staff was very friendly, helpfull and hardworking."
"11906","We didn't understand that there were two part/riads for orangers d'alilia. We read on another bookingsite that there was a swimmingpool. This wasn't the case in the Riad were we stayed. Unfortunately, because with 30 degrees in the afternoon it would be lovely for our girls to get a plunge in the pool. The last day we discovered,  30 metres of our Riad a 5* hotel (les Jardins..) where we could make a package deal for lunch and swim.  The room was charming, clean, but a little bit small. The breakfast was plenty but every day the same."
"11907","Very good breakfast. Room was excellent, clean and comfortable. Best shower in Europe! Location is good just out of the loud hustle and bustle of la rambla. "
"11908","You get what you pay for. For the money this is a great deal. I paid $80 US a night inclusive, Beaches very nice, food was fine, the restaurants good. "
"11909","Fantastic staff. The most serviceminded staff we have ever met. The beach is nice and clean and really clear water."
"11910","It would got ful pot if it had wi-fi, but that I know is not the hotels foult so....."
"11911","Nice to stay at . We stayed in second block separate from hotel only 5min from beach. If you stay in the main hotel use the roof top super views and a sun trap."
"11912","Kitchen needs an oven or at least a grill. Two ring hob , microwave and toaster is all we had to cook on.  If we had an oven we could not ask for anymore ."
"11913","Very nice hotel, perfect location and helpful staff. Will definitely go back "
"11914","Good and convenient location. Near shops, food and mrt station.  Although room is small, it is very clean and has required necessities for good rest.  Bed and pillow very comfy."
"11915","No bar fridge in the room. No wardrobe which is not really a problem if there are sufficient hanging hooks in the room. There are only 2 hooks in the room"
"11916","We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was very central to the sancatry and shops."
"11917","Hotel was amazing! Would reccomend to anyone. Perfect location ony 2 stops from Dam Central taking around 12 minutes on the train. Hotel has a great pool, sauna, gym and steam room on the 2nd floor. Awesome hotel. Very good helpful friendly staff. I stay at a lot of hotels in business and this is up there with the best of them. Would stay there in a heart beat. "
"11918","Excellent reception - Grace was very helpful."
"11919","Hot water out of the cold water tap! No cold water with the effect that water was frequently too hot to use in the shower."
"11920","Nice surroundings, close to transports, easy to find!"
"11921","Well positioned from airport. Though buildings are old and the hair dryer did not work it is clean. Good room service from hotel restaurant."
"11922"," Limousine service was not booked when requested to take me to   Air Asia airport. When it did turn up it was a shuttle bus. I was not informed of alternatives and mislead by service that operates from hotel lobby. To top it off the driver kept asking for a tip. A taxi is much cheaper, or alternatively if flying Air Asia you can catch the hotel shuttle (free) to the ""New Airport"" then get on a shuttle that will take you to the airport where ""Air Asia"" operates from (cost 3 ringets) which takes approximately 20 minutes from the ""new airport""."
"11923","Friendly staff and great location"
"11924","Central location, good humor and great service from the staff. Great breakfast and lovely spa area. No noise from the outside, despite the central location. Comfortable beds. Good that we could borrow a kettle and got refills of coffee powder daily. The neighboring restaurant Edel-weiss is highly recommended :)"
"11925","The pillows; one tiny(30 x 30cm) and one far too big(60x60 cm).  A medium sized pillow would have made our sleep even better! We missed a safe in the room. "
"11926","Excellent hotel overall.Gym and tennis facilities very good."
"11927","Towels were placed on sun beds at 6.00 am by some people! Clients were older on average!"
"11928","Nice hotel in good location. The Born area is great with many small and excellent restaurants and bars."
"11929","Bathroom need improwntt. People Talking loudly in public aera in the evening."
"11930","Very helpfull and Friendly staff  The hotel is near the sea  Definately will come again! "
"11931","Very good location."
"11932","Didn't have much choice of TV channels."
"11933","Staff were very efficient and helpful,  food was ok.  Leisure centre looked great but didn't get the opportunity to try it out."
"11934","Rooms in serious need of modernisation,  and redecorating quite old an shabby looking. The car park was a joke after being told to come back in an hour for the third time gave up and parked on the street. "
"11935","Good location  Nice new design   Nice facilities -top roof pool and jacuzzi.gym and spa.  Very serviceminded and proffesional staff"
"11936","Difficult to find transportation from hotel area.  Not taxi stand in area.  Lots of constructing work all around the hotel"
"11937","This hotel was amazing for children and our experience was fantastic. Great value for money and I would highly recommend it to all families going to disneyland :) I would go back in a heart beat. Drinks where a bit over priced but apart from that every thing else was superb "
"11938","The balls pit in Main lobby needs to be padded around edges as my two year old got a back eye from this which was bad enough. "
"11939","Very good hotel. Had everything that one could expect. "
"11940","The location "
"11941","The restaurant is massively overpriced - the pizza on the menu that they charge £11.95 for is a frozen Chicago Town one which costs £5 max in any supermarket. I understand that hotels are generally more expensive than bars/restaurants etc but i find that very excessive.    But it served its purpose "
"11942","The location."
"11943","Bad quality-price ratio. The staff is not so helpful and the hotel has no parking so you have to leave your car in a public parking (40 ch a day)"
"11944","They had vacancies"
"11945","Slooow help at the counter.  Loose toilet in the room.  Half the lights didn't work.  Expensive."
"11946","we were on the first floor next to a very busy main road looking  russell square it kept us awake most of the night even though we closed both outside and inside windows."
"11947","No fridge in the room"
"11948","Great location!! Ocean front rooms have great ocean views"
"11949","Rooms are old and need refurbishing, especially bathrooms, no character.  "
"11950","Great hotel to stay at! the staff were incredibly helfpul and friendly and the room even though it was teh standard room was spacious and very comfortable. And the bed was extremely comfortable! Would definately stay here again."
"11951","Friendly hotel. Ideal location. Value for money if u get a deal. We have stayed many times and the price really varies. This time we were not so lucky. Superior rooms still only have a standard double bed. We have been told by staff the only diff between standard and superior are the two bottles of water that reception sell for £1 and wifi.. However the difference in prices for the two rooms can be steep....   Overall a good hotel that we will use but cld do more with making the rooms reflect their sometimes high prices..  "
"11952","Lovely hotel in a beautiful location.Room lovely staff very friendly and helpful.Food beautiful.Will definitely return for another stay."
"11953","Exceptional customer service, rooms and Rib Room Restaurant is excellent - best hotel in London"
"11954","Friendly staff brill location in middle of broad street and bullring"
"11955","When we arrived another couple were checking in infront of us, but immediately another member of staff appeared and checked us in. When they realised they couldn't fit us in for dinner at the time we wanted they phoned a local restaurant and made a booking. The hotel was hosting two parties and two coach trips they they made sure our room was well away from the noise.  This is a good place to stay, we have used it a number of times, the beds are great, the showers superb and the staff well trained."
"11956","They still have a smoking area outside the front of the hotel but at least they have moved it away from the doors so the smoke doesn't float up into the bedroom windows. Still better to ask for an odd numbered room."
"11957","Hey!  I and my boyfriend stayed at Narcia Resort Side from 10/11/2013 till 10/20/2013.  We had a nice stay. Everyone who worked there from the reception,bargirls/barmen,waiters,cleaning workers,animation team were so nice and give good service!  When I came to Antalya my baggage was still in Amterdam but came to Hotel two days later. The reception help me call to the airport and it worked out just fine!  Good food and I was also part of the Sultan show one evening!  Memories for life!!  With kind regards     Monika Beitland  Norway  NB! I was the only guest from Norway by the  :-)"
"11958","The hotel was in a great location, the staff were friendly and helpful .The bar was great ,fantastic cocktails and staff were  lovely. Would stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone."
"11959","We were on the top floor and it was skylight windows so had no views."
"11960","Hotel nice and clean everything you need just DON'T book by hotelopia as when I got to the hotel there was no reservation in my name and my card had been debited you have been warned"
"11961","the hotel is lovely the staff on the whole are great. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the gardens are beautiful and very well kept.It is a lovely place to stay in a beautiful location. "
"11962","the pool service was very slow and the bar in reception was useless, we gave up a couple of times we went for a drink before dinner and left with out getting one!!"
"11963","It was a lovely large room,very quiet with a lovely comfortable bed and a beautifully renovated bathroom and was located centrally to everything so it was so convenient."
"11964","The carpet had bad stains in it everywhere and desperately needed a steam clean which really should be done asap as it mkes the room look dirty."
"11965","Nice view , in center of town, very good hotel "
"11966","Everything was perfect! Excellent variety of food, very clean and the room was very nice! Would definitely consider going back!!"
"11967","It was really a wonderful experience staying at Palais dago Hotel, Bandung. It is more than a hotel with all comforts and hospitality. I really enjoyed the stay from 21-25 October, 2013 and my other colleagues who stayed in other hotels envied us so much. I would love to come back again to Bandung and stay at the hotel again."
"11968","Comfortable and convenient"
"11969","Beautiful setting and rooms. Warm welcome. Stones throw from everything to see in York."
"11970","Cooked breakfast costs extra and not really worth the money ontop of the continental breakfast rate. Valet Parking costs 20 quid and your waiting for them to bring it back when you check out. Staff were busy when we left but made a massive difference, complained about the room being too hot and noisy throughout the night and just felt rushed not the same nice welcome we had before. Concierge was blunt."
"11971","fantastic location.   Easy and very pleasant walks to shops.  Excellent restaurants close by.  Enthusiastic staff, very keen to assist, always pleasant."
"11972","Central position but seaview supplement essential. Modern room. Lovely spa, reasonable prices, free pool, sauna and steam room.     "
"11973","The web site said there was a sauna and indoor swimming pool however there was a solarium and swimming pool. Very disappointing. The view out my very small window was the exhaust of a car in the car park as the rooms are lower than the car park.  (he paint was peeling on the windows and there was mildew on them in the restaurant there was a hen party on the Saturday night which was directly above our room. It was so loud I had to complain. It did get slightly lower but was not the ambience I was expecting.  However the outside grounds of the hotel were beautiful the room was very disappointing for the cost of it. I would not stay there again."
"11974","Was reasonably situated 15 min walk to tube  Or 5 min drive free parking a plus  "
"11975","Arrived early after a long journey from Manchester driving   (11.30) just wanted to check in and relax for a while  Was told check in was not til 2:30 either leave your bags and come back  Or pay £15 extra per room(2) what a choice not happy about that"
"11976","Afordable hotel with Spa facilities"
"11977","Swimming pool good. Clean and food delicious."
"11978","Reserved room not available so change to another room type but with no seaview.   Transportation to Patong is not convenient. Suggest to increase hotel shuttle bus frequency."
"11979","The staff were very friendly and helpful - in particular Kwanele at reception, and Shillar in the restaurant. Lovely hotel, centrally located, secure property"
"11980","Safe not working, and room service access would have been nice"
"11981","We ate Italien buffet one night, the food taste, quality is good. Price is reasonable. "
"11982","Beds are not comfortable, I stayed at least 5 other Hilton hotels, and the beds were very soft and comfortable. "
"11983","The room was generally comfortable and the staff efficient. The wine was excellent"
"11984","The dinner, by comparison with the excellent breakfast on my previous stay, was dull and exepnsive; the pate was tasteless and the duck both tasteless and tough. The sauce was too subdued"
"11985","good location. nice and helpful staff."
"11986","Staff seem to be efficient, room cleaning every day(requested), cleanliness is okay.  Worth the money for the three stars. Security is strong probably because of the surrounding area - little india "
"11987","Location is very "
"11988","The staff has to start working on their service skills and be trained how meet customers.  Check in  cant not take 30min if the rooms are prepaid....Time work on process and speed up the check in.    We will not stay and recommend this Hotel to anyone.    "
"11989","Impressive entrance: courtyard with fountain. Grand foyer. Pleasant room. Not comfortable for any more than one night.  Breakfast (food) was satisfactory. Easy access to the West End: huge advantage."
"11990","Check in staff seemed stressed. Same member of check in staff had no recollection of my previous stay on 11 October. Breakfast service poor. Had to go up to coffee station to be noticed. Only then was I served. Member of waiting staff complained that I should not have been sitting where I was seated!! Unbelievable comment."
"11991","We had a wonderful 3 night stay in this hotel.The breakfast was 'world class' and the evening meal was real 'fine dining'.  The staff were very professional and friendly . Location from the airport was very accessible just 20 mins in taxi with  lovely marina views on one side and beach views on the other.  The weather was mixed but on the rainy days we used  the lovely indoor pool.  We would definately go back."
"11992","i was up-graded to a recently renovated room and this was nice,, "
"11993","the staff are either  or act that , the service was that bad that i left the hotel for another hotel although i had paid for the stay.   my complaints were ignored and decided to leave"
"11994","What a great Riad. Beautifull en friendly staff. Breakfast is very nice. You can sit on the terrace roof. Would stay here again."
"11995","Friendly helpful staff. Had a swim each day and the changing facilities were excellent. Bar meal was excellent value and very tasty and breakfast was excellent too. Could not fault our stay and was extremely good value for money. Would definitely return and would recommend. No problem parking  having found the hotel easily by following instructions on web site."
"11996","GReat location for our requirements.  Beach is only a few metres away with lots of restaurants and convenience stores nearby.  Pool is great and with the slides, kids would have a great time."
"11997","I have stayed your hotel already 4 times and I was expected everytime little better than last time.  Basically your staff cooperative and polite ,particularly Breakfast room girls are excellent. "
"11998","I stayed room 311, first of all, bath room particulary in toilet,  I found hair on floor, under Weight scale    Additionally, during night time I guess there were party on 4 th floor, and foot noise was very dirturbed."
"11999","Staff were so friendly and helpful. Had a problem with my room card on arrival and it was sorted so quickly by the lovely staff. The hotel is so gorgeous. Such an old-school glamour which is still warm and inviting and really topped off my fun weekend!"
"12000","Great hotel will deffo return!"
"12001","Not close to a tube station but there is a bus stop outside the door "
"12002","Great location, good standard of hotel, staff very helpful would stay here again"
"12003","Smell of smoke in our room was rather off putting especially as supposed to be a non smoking environment."
"12004","Room clean,good facilities,near to we're we needed to go,"
"12005","Nice Hotel, close to the beach and shops, friendly staff."
"12006","The rooms were old style and dirty  The beds terrible  The Spa very dirty and old  Almost broke my foot on this old woodenfloor  the sealing in the pool area was very dirty and things fell off    In the steemsauna the floor was broken    Very disappoint for a 4 star hotel  I only would give it 2     "
"12007","Great hotel well placed in the middle of broad st. The room was very good great facilities very modern. Stayed on the 15th floor great views of the city. Great breakfast in the morning as well.  Would definitely stay there again"
"12008","The only negative thing is the cost of the parking of your car for £10"
"12009","Citadines is an ideal place to stay if going to an event at the Barbican. It is also very close to the tube although we chose to walk everywhere (it takes approximately an hour to walk from Victoria station). The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful and the room was clean with all facilities. The kitchen area is ideal for longer stays too. We would definitely return."
"12010","the hotel is good, near the beach, only 5 minutes to the mushroom beach."
"12011","Staff were very friendly and helpful"
"12012","The room we stayed in was in need of reburbishment"
"12013","Very pleasant stay, comfortable, clean and spacious, with friendly and courteous staff. Convenient to central Melbourne, and we would definitely go back or recommend."
"12014","It's only minor, but nicer complimentary tea and coffee sachets would be an improvement."
"12015","- Hotel Location is very good.  - Room is clean and beautiful.  - Bed is comfortable."
"12016","- Management is very bad because we found wedding party at nigth that stage is near our room and make straining noise through the night. We called to hotel staff twice time at 23:00 and 23:30 but they told that they do not know when the party finish. Finally, They cannot control the volume. We have to sleep like we are in the party too.  - Breakfast is not various to select.  - Fitness room is small and difficult to find.  "
"12017","Good facilities, excellent value for money"
"12018","very pleasant"
"12019","car parking fees. not told beforehand that parking would be extra. why should  it be? also not advised about driving difficulties reaching hotel. we had to back out of a narrow street and take a long time finding the only  in. big cars are not suitable"
"12020","This hotel was in a great location, 5 min walk to Jordan mtr and 2min walk to temple street night market. We stayed in the family room which had plenty enough room for myself, wife and 2 teenage daughters. The roof top pool was relaxing after a day out, with amazing views. There is a 7-eleven and Starbucks over the road which can save on hotel prices. Overall would recommend this hotel- it maybe a bit pricey but so are all hotels in Hong Kong and remember this room can accommodate 5 people."
"12021","Good value Hotel ,good location with Gym. Food was plentiful of average quality.Gym available not no sauna."
"12022","Staff could be more engaging."
"12023","staff very polite and helpful.Good parking.Excellent breakfast."
"12024","Paper thin walls and very noisy neighbours until 3.30am.When reported staff reacted immediately but unfortunately the girls in the adjoining room took no notice.We were left unable to sleep most of the night., but for £35 we could not expect much more"
"12025","Excellent position. Plenty of hot water. Good breakfast choice."
"12026","No cards for Internet. Noisy air-con. No windows. Needs some TLC."
"12027","Grounds and gardens lovely,nice pool,rooms nice all facilities bath and shower,nice walk to beach approx 40mns,girls cleaning rooms friendly Lovely friendly staff in the reasonably priced hotel small supermarket"
"12028","The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times from management through to cleaning staff. Length of time for breakfast was generous and food was always available and regularly topped up. This is a small hotel and quite old it appears to have had a sort of makeover but some time ago. Fresh towels provided each day."
"12029","We stayed for a week, there was no wardrobe to hang clothes, nowhere in the room to put luggage for the week, had to live out of the suitcase, not impressed. Room was not as advertised, nowhere to sit and relax, not even a lounge area as an alternative to the room. Air conditioning was good in room but not so great in the rest of the hotel. Bathroom was not great, very small and very poor drainage in the shower requiring us to put towels down to soak up the water each day. Room and bathroom not well cleaned, particularly behind doors and under beds."
"12030","Valet parking good.if pricey."
"12031","Bathroom dirty und loo rim and bottom of bath and soap dish,extractor fan not working,lifts so slow."
"12032","We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Hotel Vila Lumbung. The staff were lovely and very accommodating of our needs. We stayed in the hotel rooms, not the bungalows. There were a few marks on the walls and a couple of marks on the bed cover but otherwise it was perfect. My second floor balcony overlooked the pool which I enjoyed. The breakfast was simple but more than adequate. The pool area was clean and there were always sun lounges available. We had a great stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
"12033","Only negative was that the reception staff were not overly cheerful."
"12034","For 2 adults and 2 kids, we were given a very spacious room with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.   We extensively used the free shuttle service provided by the hotel for the main city attractions.   The swimming pool on the roof offers a great view on the Downtown skyscrapers.  Interesting choice for the breakfast. "
"12035","The free wifi was only available in the lobby and relatively slow."
"12036","no water and water too slow.TV transmission so poor."
"12037","A very charming hotel and clean.  Personal is very helpfull and nice.  Very good positon of the hotel, near of Alhambra on a quiet street  Very good breakfast with many choices"
"12038","The beds are very unconfortable.  The space of breakfast buffet is very small, closed. If many people (5 people for ex) near buffet, we have to wait that they are served, otherwise we can't move around the buffet..."
"12039","Lovely room, bed really comfy!!! Ideal place for walking into the city "
"12040","This is a great little hotel perfectly located for both down and uptown. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. "
"12041","The hotel room was spacious, the restaurant food was nice good breakfast,  staff were very friendly and helpful."
"12042","The leisure centre was very disappointing the pool was very basic. Also there was not enough seating to cater for guests in the foyer area. Check in is not until 4pm which is rather late."
"12043","Absolutely fantastic. Its perfect for families. Everything you could ever want and need from a hotel, especially when you're with children."
"12044","Very good value for money. The staff were very good."
"12045","Central location to bus stops and train station. Close to town center"
"12046","Good location  Lovely view of pool "
"12047","Very modern room facilities (in relation to the beds, linen, bathroom, tv, free room wifi, air con, kettle) and all in good condition.    Great location just off the main street in the old town - means that it is easy to come back to the hotel during the day if necessary (eg drop off shopping, pick up a jacket, etc) and easy to get to the hotel at night if you stay out late.  Yet no problem with street noise when inside the room, even with the window open.  Easily walkable to the central train station for the airport."
"12048","cant think of any."
"12049","Welcoming and friendly staff from receptionist to the waiters/bar staff  Room was quite spacious and very clean"
"12050","Took me awhile to find te hotel but apart from that nothing negative to say"
"12051","good location and value for money"
"12052","We had a described as a single bed studio with full kitchen.  The kitchen comprised a sink, toaster and electric jug with cutlery and crockery for 2.  Table for 2, double bed with TV mounted on wall at foot of bed and air-conditioner above the bedhead.  Just enough room to walk around the bed.  The bathroom was fine.  So it is probably best described as a passage expanded in the middle to accommodate a bed and minimal eating area.  There was a lap pool, but only 1.1m deep so not very enjoyable. We did not use the small gym.  Possibly our experience would have been better if we chose multiple bedroom suite as the building is relatively new a looked as if it would be well appointed."
"12053","clean and good facilites"
"12054","Stayed for just one night while on vacation from Bonnie Scotland. My hubby, kids and I loved the hotel and wished we could have stayed for longer. Staff was very pleasant and private beach is all you could ask for. My little one loved the pool at early o'clock also. "
"12055","Had to pay $10 for parking when it should be free to guests of the hotel. "
"12056","Location, vews from the room or restaurant, the room was very big and confortable. Staff was kind."
"12057","The parking was 22 euros each day. Very expensive in my opinion.  I would suggest to add more things to the frigo-bar. "
"12058","Stayed there with my daughter '7yearold' she loved the water resort the only reason you should stay here"
"12059","I had three nights here and have no complaints. Two impressive people - the man who checked us in could not have been more friendly or helpful, even though we were more than three hours too early, and the guy running the restaurant did everything right, making us feel very welcome. I'd go again    "
"12060"," All rooms have aircon, but you might need to ask for the remote control!"
"12061","Great location. Friendly and helpfull staff."
"12062","Limited continental breakfast."
"12063","The quadruple room was large and the reception area clean and receptionist friendly."
"12064","The ""full English"" breakfast was not that - it was a platter of sliced meat and cheese, two cereals and white sliced toast with jams and the orange juice was more like squash than juice.  It was fine but not what we were expecting from the website."
"12065","close to the beach, balcony, plenty of local information, ideal if you only need the hotel as a base to sleep and store your clothes, "
"12066","the hotel advertise a Wi-Fi facility which you can pay for however if your apartment is on the beach side of the road you cannot get Wi-Fi    the hotel is split into two separate locations the beach side has no Wi-Fi or private pool you have to cross a busy road to get to the pool.   their are bars situated directly underneath the first floor apartments which are open until late so if you have small children or you like to relax in the hotel of an evening this is not easily achieved. The rooms have a good spacious bathroom not of very good quality the water is heated by an emersion heater so if you have more than two people staying in the room you have to wait for the water to reheat between showers.  their is a fridge , microwave, Kettle and hob provided , the hotel provide towels that are not changed regularly we stayed for four nights and had no room service over the whole stay. they also provide a tea towel and dish cloth and a small tube of washing up liquid and one small toilet roll to begin your stay. their are plenty of supermarkets around the hotel however if you are on a budget it may be worth shopping further away from the hotel, take a shopping bag with you because their is a charge for carrier bags and they are not very good quality. hope that this information is of use.  televisions are also provided which have 3 British channels and various other channels.   the hotel is approximately a 2mile walk from the centre of Salou and 3mile walk from cambrills and a bus ride to port Aventura so you could say it is ideally located. you can get public transport from outside the hotel and their are taxis available. "
"12067","The girl on reception was lovely and even upgraded me to a better room than the one I had booked.  She was pleasant, efficient and helpful."
"12068","On the first evening I stayed I went into the bar to eat something.  Two men were serving and I said to each of them at least 3 times that I was ready to order food and each time they brushed me off.  After 20 minutes no one had taken my order so I walked out.  I went to Centra next door, bought a sandwich and ate that in my room.  I told all of this to the lovely receptionist who apologised on their behalf.  If they continue to run the bar in that  they will go broke.  "
"12069","hotel is well located in the middle of passig de gracia, close to a metro station, not far from plaza catalonia. the room are modern and spacious, equipped with a nice lighting system, bath is spacious as well and always clean. 62 will be one of my top option if i am going again to barcelona.   "
"12070","there no much negatives about this hotel, i would say if they have more tv channels will be nice. a proper concierge as well."
"12071","Food in restaurant was excellent, service a little slow, but a big function in other room, so understandable,"
"12072","Rooms are a little small, but got everything you need in there, and beds were very comfortable."
"12073","Very nice room. We had a  great time in the hotel."
"12074","Very expencive hotel"
"12075","Staff is lacking of experience   Bed sheets and towels changed everyday though the eco responsible hotel policy"
"12076","Within walking distance of mainline  railway station (Santa Just a) and airport bus stop opposite hotel. Also close to Nervion Centre (shops and cinemas)"
"12077","Not within walking distance of cathedral and other sights"
"12078","Cigarette smoke and sewage odour in the room. Old durty carpet.  We were invisible to the bar personnel and took our business elsewhere."
"12079","Good location, nice and clean hotel"
"12080","When you book the economy room you don't know that there are no windows until you pay  The air ventilation system did not work fine and it was like in a sauna"
"12081","The place is very clean and comfortable, and right across it is a tram stop where you can reach Munich Hauptbahnhof in 3 to 6 minutes. The kitchen facilitiies is great.  A good place to stay during the Oktoberfest festival since the site is a walking distance"
"12082","No table if you cook your own food"
"12083","Lovely staff, clean room, good location close to MTR.  The hotel was good value, and I would recommend it."
"12084","good value close to every thing  that a tourist would enjoy"
"12085","Room was very spacious , clean and comfortable.  Staff friendly and helpful, quiet central location"
"12086","Internet never worked during my stay, but not uncommon in Libya only worked once in 3 different hotels.   Food average"
"12087","Very helpful, friendly staff especially the ladies who service the rooms,     brilliant variety food and drinks selection    4 pools so no overcrowding"
"12088","(1) Horrible view of dilapidated buildings behind Copacobana and the building site generated so much dust that went everywhere in the room    (2) WIFI is extremely slow and kept freezing / logging off all the time and at 4 Euros/ day it ain't worth it    (3) whole family came down with a mysterious upset stomach and vomiting bug a few days into the holiday    (4) the luggage holding area in Acupulco needs redesigning and to be made more secure for individuals storing their luggage in there...some lockers perhaps    (5) Reception area could be better organised and demarcated properly with different aisles for check-in , general enquires and excursion bookings etc    (6) Better information could be given about the timings or seasons so that travellers [before they book!] know when certain activities are available (eg barbeque and children's entertainment)    (7) Difficult to locate the staff responsible for booking guests into activities ( I briefly saw one man in all the 8 nights I was there)"
"12089","the hotel is very well situated"
"12090","not once for the 4 days we were there did we see the reception nor the breakfast staff smille it was as if they just did not want to be there.The choice of t.v. channels was non existant you had one english speaking channel and that was bbc world news that repeated every 30 minutes. Now after a long day away from early morning touring and sight-seeing you would like after dinner at night to have a nice shower and relax by watching something on t.v. you had no choice in this hotel as everything was in polish.Best western need to keep up with the times we are in the digital era sky t.v ect.  "
"12091","Very friendly and helpful staff, overall very pleasant stay and excellent value."
"12092","Fine decor and wonderful pool areas"
"12093","Staff very inatentive at bars, particularly pool bar, left standing while bar replenished with either cups glasses etc. only pool bar open during day so if the weather wasn't good it meant a trip of about 200 meters to get a drink!"
"12094","The price was totally OK."
"12095","There was just nothing outstanding. It was so ho-hum. Most of the staff were quite adequate. TV was terrible. Would it break the bank to add a couple interesting channels?"
"12096","a  simple hotel at a good location. close to the shops and the beach.   friendly staff , who like to give you the feeling you're at home.  was here before and will come later again."
"12097","tv receive is not so good and i missed a channel with music or a radio."
"12098","close to metro station and in heart of Bur Dubai, free water bottle and news paper"
"12099","Poor maintenance, owner does not wish to spend a single penny on maintenance or refurbishment.  No in room tea or coffee facilities  Poor or rather filthy bed linen, towels carpet, curtains, lightings"
"12100","the hotel was very clean and bright. the staff were very helpful. it was extremely quiet despite there being a lot of guests staying there. it was very close to the theatre which is what we wanted."
"12101","restaurant for breakfast was small for the number of guests staying there. we were allowed to take breakfast to our room, which we did, as i was not feeling well."
"12102","Breakfast was simple but fresh. The bedding was clean and fresh. "
"12103","I booked a double room for me and my daughter, i got a room with four beds. I booked transfer from airport to hotel but endup taking a taxi at 1.30am, because transfer never arraved to pick us up. "
"12104","Great location, very cheap and clean, bed was comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Free Wifi in lobby and 24hr bar with very reasonable prices."
"12105","I had stay 4 days in this hotel.  As I had booked 2 nights in superior room via package and 2 nights in standard room via hotelopia,  I had told the receptionist when I checked in.  I told her we dont want to changing room so we could stay in standard room for 4 nights and the receptionist said its ok,  we could stay in superior room for 4 nights.  I double confirmed with her and she said we dont need to change room.  However,  after 2 nights,  when we hang out around 10am.  The housekeeping said we need to check out today and we go straight to receptionist to ask and she said its ok we dont need to check out and change room.  However !!!!! When we back to hotel at 11pm,  we found that the access card was not work and found the receptionist to ask the reason.  The receptionist said we need to chang room !!!!  Thats really a bad impression and i think no one could stand this.  We changed room finally.  "
"12106","Staff is awsome.They always make sure you are nr. 1 and give you 100% securities. "
"12107","No WIFI at the room (but they will arrange it for you on requests.) Food choice at breakfast is poor, also to much asian food. Closets in the room needs improvment and more space."
"12108","Good room, good staff, great location."
"12109","New, clean , convenient , free shuttle bus"
"12110","very good nice place ..near the shops near the sea...:) :)"
"12111","Spa facilities were excellent.   Bike hire available which is ideal for exploring local area."
"12112","Location of hotel.  Not near any restaurants Car essential to get about.  First night we spent over half an hour trying to find somewhere to eat, that was walking from one end of town to other.  Not many places open on Sunday evenings out of season."
"12113","Vicinity to beach restaurant and bars was excellent, staff very friendly and helpful, rooms light bright and airy - nothing negative to say at all and would definitely stay there again, in fact just about to book again for next year"
"12114","Very relaxing great ambience from room"
"12115","Stag need training. Device up and down"
"12116","The hotel is beautiful with a real family feel to it. Lovely and helpful staff. Situated in the heart of Side and within walking distance to the beach and shops not forgetting the historical parts, you can't ask for anything better. "
"12117","Could maybe do with extra plug sockets in the rooms."
"12118","Close to Disneyland, staff were very helpful when having to transport 16 bags to the bus stop."
"12119","- streetside rather noisy  - small television, few non-spanish programs, bad signal  - shower enclosure doesn't close well"
"12120","We upgraded to a Harbour Club room.  This comes with a breakfast (You do need to ask for the menu for cooked options such as eggs, for some reason it is not freely offered) and a truly magnificent view from the club lounge of the whole of Victoria Harbour.  The teatime and cocktail snacks were excellent as was the cocktail selection, which also included mocktails, European beers and ciders, wine and spirits.  The rooms were comfortable, and the glass wall to the bathroom is swiftly dealt with by using the electric blind!  If I ever do return to Hong Kong I would happily stay again"
"12121","Service in the Club during breakfast and cocktails was very slow, and replenishment of buffet items at breakfast was not great, it was annoying to wait 20 minutes for an egg order only to find that the bacon you were going to have with it had run out for the time being.  Given the quality of the rest of the hotel this was a frustration"
"12122","The matras could Be netter, I could feel the springs in my back"
"12123","This hotel is in a really good location for getting to all the main places to see in Philadelphia, and is also really close to City Center bars, restaurants and shopping.  The room we had was nothing too fancy but was clean and had all of the basic stuff that you need, including coffee that was restocked daily.  We were really impressed with the staff who were always friendly, and one in particular went out of his  to offer tips for local running routes when he saw us heading out for a jog one morning.  The main thing about this hotel is that if offers you good value for money in a city center location in a really cool city!"
"12124","On the Saturday night some of the other guests were being particularly loud in nearby rooms.  Not the hotels fault as such, but might be worth considering if you like the quiet life!"
"12125","a well run hotel, very clean and good standards. a very comfortable hotel. staff friendly and English spoken.  Central located for the beach and the town for all the amenities"
"12126","No parking without a 14 euros a night charge, on street parking difficult, but public parking area nearby"
"12127","Easy to get to from the airport (Airport bus 21, Hotel Linda stop, price 3 Euros as at N0V 13). Near nice clean beaches, restaurants and supermarkets.    Front desk not manned 24/7 but contact can be made via the bar next door.    I also arranged car hire via hotel with rent a car 2011 which is next to the hotel.Car hire cost 50 Euros for 2 days (   you had to pay for petrol used) "
"12128","The Bathroom was very dark, also the plants outside the balcony of 153 were very obstructive would be a better outlook if maybe the plants could be trimmed."
"12129","Comfortable, big room with easy-to-regulate air-condition system. Good to get heated rooms when you travel off season.   Excellent breakfast.  "
"12130","Lovely spacious spotlessly clean room. Staff were exceptionally accommodating.  Very welcoming personable staff. Hotel has a great location. Easy to get to on foot or tram from city centre."
"12131","Very clean and spacious room for a single person. No bath but powerful shower. Reception staff helpful and professional. I`d read some poor reviews so wasn`t expecting much but it was really nice. Lots of couples and families. I took a cab from kings cross but caught the bus back as stops right outside. Would definitely stay again."
"12132","Only thing I mentioned to reception was that there's nowhere in the room or your key card to tell you breakfast  and checkout times but they do tell you verbally when you check in. "
"12133","Staff very helpful. Good big bedroom.  Good location"
"12134","No lift.  No grab handles in bath/shower making it dangerous for older person to shower"
"12135","Amazing unique hotel inside the fort. "
"12136","  English breakfast included ( 15,00 P. extra ) is not good because you have to make a choice from the menu for lat's say 4,00  P . The furniture in the room was completely worn-out , to little and to small ."
"12137","centrally situated.nice views of the river.very comfortable bed.easy access.great for a one night stay."
"12138","If you pay for parking( £10) it runs out at checkout - 11 am.We arrived for a late check in after coming from the airport, so it wasn't worth paying for,- we parked free at the riverside then got up at 8 am to move the vehicle.The nearest NCP only opens till 10.30pm, and as we were going to a concert, we would have been locked in.Best value for earlybird parking is the NCP behind the station (not at the station).  Had problems changing channels with the remote, and had to request an iron and ironing board from reception.  On the whole a pleasant stay though."
"12139","Nice location and SPA though a little tired is a nice touch. "
"12140","Bed was very small only 4’6 when we are used to a kingsize felt very small and also it was sloping to the middle which was very uncomfortable. "
"12141","Near city center and well connected"
"12142","Near bad reputation locals"
"12143","The rooms are very modern and clean.  "
"12144","I had the single room, it's closer to the size of a cupboard but perfectly acceptable for one night sleeping accommodation (bathroom door only partly opens before it hits the bed, there's no room to use the chair at the table either)     More importantly, the £10 charge for the secure carpark is total rubbish, the carpark is waste ground in the dark at the back of the hotel in front of derelict garages.  I was luck to have a 4x4 since you have to bump over a high curb to gain access to parking.  Since it is not gated, I was told there is monitored CCTV (reply to me saying I was uncomfortable at leaving my car on waste ground in the dark behind the hotel which as full public access) however when I left the hotel at 05:15 the 24hour receptionist was snoring on the sofa in the dark, which is probably why he didn't make my alarm call either."
"12145","Excellent location and value for money."
"12146","Great hotel, great staff and good location ideal for theatre and station would stay again"
"12147","The staff were not fluent in English and when we wanted our breakfast, the meal times kept changing. The bathroom had a leak around the toilet seat too. We mentioned this to the staff and it wasn't sorted. Next time ,will definately pay a bit more for a better hotel. "
"12148","This hotel is very nice and a good location for budget travellers. Staff is very professional, friendly and helpfull and make you feel very welcome. Rooms are clean and they change your sheets and towels every day unless you ask them not to. AC is fully functional and a good friend to a traveller in Dubai. The hotel is not in the fancy part of town but next to a major transport point from where you can easily get everywhere wich is very positive as there are many cheap, quality restaurants and grocerie stores nearby so for s/he who is not looking to pay six times as much for the very same things in Dubai it's a great location as Dubai is a city where prize depends on location"
"12149","The only negative things about the hotel is that the wi-fi is not free, you get a 20 mb download quota a day and elseway have to pay a lot for internet access. Also it is not fair of them to say they have a swimming pool as it is in another part of town at a sister hotel. You can go there and dip in for free but have to pay for transportation. They do however offer you transportation to the pool and back with access to the gym at the other hotel plus lunch for an extremely fair prize so you don't really feel cheated by the whole thing. Also it is a non-alcaholic hotel but they didn't seem very strict on that if drunkardness was not followed by bringing in alcahol"
"12150","Stayed in the hotel 7 months before, food and services for breakfast buffet became worse and less choice, painting on bath tub peel off like powder during bathing. Many ugly stains accumulated on gap between tiles around bath tub, no cleaning. Over-aged in-room facility."
"12151","Staff changed room when requested"
"12152","Worn out decorations not changed for at least 9yrs since my last visit, curtain falling off, breakfast room too hot, quality of breakfast poor, chilled cabinet in dining room with noisy motor."
"12153","The staff were all very polite and helpful, particularly in the restaurant. Both the dinner and breakfast were of the highest quality"
"12154","Reception staff very helpful."
"12155","Breakfast not the best quality"
"12156","Lovely view from room of ships. Able to open the window for fresh air.  Breakfasts were sensational, lots to choose from and high quality.. Had lunch at restaurant which was good value and delicious. Location was close to city centre and tourist spots.  Tram stopped right outside the hotel."
"12157","Gym was pitiful in size and equipment. Only one running machine, one cross trainer, one bike and one other machine. A few loose weights and a bench.  Hotel guests including us were queued up to use the gym at peak times. Considering we had been To the Radisson in Warsaw prior to this, helsinki needs to learn a thing or two about providing a decent fitness facility for a hotel this size."
"12158","This a very clean hotel and was a value for money one night stop over"
"12159","Great accommodation if you intend to spend all your time at the hotel and use all the facilities such as the slides, pool, beach umbrellas, grotto bar etc."
"12160","Room appeared somewhat outdated. Main pool was under repair."
"12161","could not fault anything it was great upgraded our room free of charge ,spotless ,staff polite .food great,drinks at the bar cheap , location ,location ,location,  tip have a room facing the harbor sun all day after 1pm booked for February 2014 "
"12162","wanted to stay longer "
"12163","The staff is friendly and helpful"
"12164","The courtesy set in the room is really poor. At the bar the staff speak a very little english. Rooms are ok, but for a four star hotel, honestly five stars are too many."
"12165","After booking 4 standard double rooms at this hotel I started reading reviews, a lot were negative and had me worried for weeks as the check-in date got closer.  The main theme was tiny, unclean rooms.  I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived, the rooms weren't massive but not as tiny as reviews had made out (I have stayed in plenty of places with smaller rooms).  There was adequate space for two suitcases without having to climb over the top of them just to get to the toilet.  The staff were friendly and accommodating with queries.  The breakfast buffet was busy but satisfying.  The location, just across from the train station, was most convenient for us and the centre of Munich is only a 15 minute walk away.  "
"12166","The only problem we encountered was football yobbos chanting up and down the street until 3AM one night, this was out of the hotel's control so I don't blame them at all.  "
"12167","Good location, near BTS station. Comfortable room with spacious bathroom."
"12168","Concierge was unhelpful and inattentive - only had 1 person on duty and had to approach him numerous times to get things sorted out. Initially approached him to help check availability for reservation at local establishments and was quickly dismissed before even trying to call in."
"12169","Great hotel with very kind staff. The room and service was awesome!"
"12170","Staff are very friendly and helpfull. Breakfast was amazing."
"12171","Not what you expect from other reviews. Hospital like."
"12172","room too small for 3 persons. 1 bed was partly placed under a  table"
"12173","They were very obliging when we arrived in the early hours of the morning. The staff were friendly and polite.the room was clean. Provided the weather was good the rooms were fine for just sleeping in. The dining room had a terrace and an attractive view of the harbour."
"12174","Initially our quad room contained one double bed and a four foot bed which was insufficient to accommodate four adult sized people . When asked another bed was delivered.furnishing was very spartan . The chairs in the room were not really large enough to sit on. "
"12175","Good location, nice and large room, noiseless and cosy, well organized hotel transportation system."
"12176","beautiful...all you could want for a relaxing holiday"
"12177","rattly air-con and lack of information about transport"
"12178","Lovely hotel and staff. "
"12179","Nothing negative to say"
"12180","we arrived at the hotel at 6.30am knowing check-in was at 2.00pm the staff were very understanding and let us in the room straight away we were able to rest.The room was great lots of space and very clean,modern.The pool area is a great place to unwind and for my son to play in the pool was great for him,the staff were very professional and courteous.The hotel was within easy walking distance to fantastic shopping and transport will definately recommend this hotel"
"12181","i understand that it is a predominantly muslim country but some sort of refreshing alcholic drinks would have been nice "
"12182","The rooms were very comfortable.  The Reception staff were extremely helpful and service at breakfast was excellent.  I will definitely stay here again on any future trips to Oxford"
"12183","Bathroom and towels looked tired and need replacing."
"12184","This is a great hotel, it is always clean in all areas, all the staff are courteous and friendly, the rooms are of a very high standard . We also enjoyed the entertainment on an evening I  stayed here in the summer too and the selection of foods at breakfast was great. It's a lovely hotel with a friendly and relaxed atmosphere."
"12185","Perfect , within walking distance to universal so you can enjoy a few beers  Fridays next door is good of the main menu, however the breakfast although cheap is poor."
"12186","Noisy and busy road adjacent so I would not like to stay longer than a few days"
"12187","Laura and her staff were excellent and certainly went the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable!"
"12188","Great family hotel, big rooms with all facilities.  Great staff, very clean, great food (breakfast and 1700hrs kickback) great location.  "
"12189","Free wifi acces to the room with strong coverage. It is what most people look up to these days. Please keep it!"
"12190","The room is too small for the price if booking directly with the hotel. "
"12191","Nice plays, near bye the city center, quiet i the day, nice pool and staff, free parking i garage. Always avilibel sunbed. Food shoop an resturant under the hotel."
"12192","Some noise in the nigt from the city senter, they hang up used towels when they cleand the room."
"12193","Hotel is in a Great location. The rooms have the potential to be very grand with large fireplaces, high ceilings and good views across the green. Bathroom and bedding were clean. "
"12194","Had a bit of a bedsit feel about it.  Bathroom had a nasty smell inside  Mattresses were too springy and not firm enough"
"12195","sheeets are clean, location si fine ratio price is good, staff is nice and welcoming"
"12196","the floor is stained, bathroom's got dark spots of humidity here and there,  it's not extra clean without being profusely repellent as many places around,  it's one of the best spot in this range of price for casablanca"
"12197","Still the best hotel in Cairo, for me. Staff very professional and friendly. Always feel welcome and safe there  "
"12198","Convenience of the hotel to the downtown was really good.  We walked to the ACC in approximately 15 minutes."
"12199","The hotel is under renovations so there were messy areas.  The parking garage is a pain, too few spots and difficult to navigate with a larger vehicle.  The room was dated, i.e. torn sheers and spots on the curtains."
"12200","Location, very helpful staff, spotlessly clean room.  "
"12201","First visit to Italy so can only compare it to other 4* hotels i've stayed in,  in other countries.  No tea/coffee making facilities in room.  Lack of drawer space(none).  Overpriced, like Gelatto."
"12202","Friendliness of staff."
"12203","Attention should be paid to the maintenance of hotel rooms."

"12209","We went to London for the weekend and wanted to stop overnight.  The room was clean, small, cozy and functional. We enjoyed a good night sleep in a comfortable bed and there was plenty of hot water in the shower. Breakfast was adequate. Overall we can't complain.  We got good value for money."
"12210","A small compromise is the office building which overlooked our room. Not really a problem if you're a weekend visitor.  "
"12211","The hotel was an excellent choice from the start of our holiday to the end the staff were very courtious and gave us their full attention. The hotel was spick and span very clean and tidy. excellent value for money, perfect location and all we had to do was enjoy ourselves which unfortunally was'nt long enough. We will certinally be returning as soon as we can.  "
"12212","With the exception of a blackout one night when all the lights in the hotel went out, which was a bit of fun I can not find one fault"
"12213","I've stayed at several 3 star hotels but none were as bad as this one. Do not plan to stay at this LaQuinta location again."
"12214","Nice experience to be there. After a hard day of shopping was really nice to get in the sauna and the jacuzzi.   About staff professionalism we were very happy and the value for money was ok.   To get there from London Victoria by train, takes about 10min to East Croydon. From East Croydon station 5min walking to the hotel. Easy. Other side of the road is a shopping center."
"12215","Very positive feedback about everything the hotels offers. Excellent breakfast! Perfect when you bring children. "
"12216","Kids activities starts at 9 and is very loud. Not really suited for kids. But it is optional to join."
"12217","The room and the environment is nice. the staff also quite friendly. "
"12218","Too many ants, spider.   Too less facilities.  Too less variety for foods.  "
"12219","Im sorry I didnt eat at the hotel, so not able to give a precise score, so Ive relied on what the food looked like and the presentaion of it while I was looking around the buffet, ie, it was clean, smelt good and folk seemed happy?  Altogether I think this is one of the most professionally run hotels Ive ever been in."
"12220","Crazy windy passageway to reception, nearly blew the 2 x women I was with into the bushes? Also Im a lighting designer, and you should have employed one for the hotel rooms, as they are all a bit wrong, but most people wouldnt know unless I pointed it all out?"
"12221","Excellent staff and really good price as booked  in advance"
"12222","Air con noisy and light flickering in bathroom on mirror"
"12223","Stayed here once before on a similar trip and had no hesitation about selecting it again. Had an issue with finding it first time around and stated so in a previous review. This time no such problems. The rooms are modern ,clean, bright and comfortable. It is a pleasure to stay here. Plenty of choice for breakfast. Public transport right outside the door. "
"12224","nothing positive."
"12225","We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. and on our 2nd night, me and my partner was about to check out because we have some situation going on back at home so we called the front desk to check us out in about 30 minutes. And then, we have handled the situation and called the front desk again to cancelled our check out that night in less than 30 minutes prior to what we have said. and they charged us for $150 . equivalent for 3 nights! my partner doesnt wanna argue with the staff and just paid. for me, its not fair! im not gonna stay in this casino anymore. no considerations! they just want $$$.  "
"12226","Overall a pleasant experience."
"12227","Only negative was that I had to go and find some one to serve me with a drink in the bar.   "
"12228","No refridgerator, lots of nois from the street"
"12229","very nice hotel, very reasonably priced.. overall stay was excellent i would stay here again and recommend it to friends and family."
"12230","Room was flooded. Staff at made alternative arrangements and paid for taxi to other hotel."
"12231","very good hotel large rooms and beds short walk into town centre all round very good value"
"12232","breakfast not as good as before had to wait for staff to keep bringing things out  and response from waiting staff when asking to restock thing not what it should be"
"12233","Excellent location - near beaches, with great view and close distance to Gozo and Comino islands. Very nice garden and swimming pools. Water sports club in the hotel with reasonable prices. Cantine with nice terrace. Nice bars in the hotel. No traffic nor crowds near the hotel."
"12234","Free internet access - a complete disaster. We lost a lot of time trying to send some emails or browse internet. In 4* hotel wifi should definitely be free of charge all over the hotel and with reasonable performance. Very nice hotel room, although TV was small and old with limited number of available channels."
"12235","Very small rooms, and no heating, room was cold, left an item in room, called to enquire,member of staff was gong to check with housekeeper but haven't heard anything wouldn't stay here again!"
"12236","Arrived here after driving all the  from England so was quite tired.  Was therefore disappointed to be put in a room right next to what looked like the aircon hot air expulsion units for the entire hotel.  These were incredibly noisy and so I didn't sleep all night.  Though I had a two day booking because of this I told them I would not be staying the second night and to their credit they apologised and did not charge me for the second night.  I then drove along the lake and found a quieter place to stay.  Whilst the hotel has its own facilities for swimming, etc., it is quite a significant distance from the lake, even when you are there with a car, so it's not for me, I'm afraid."
"12237","The location is great, but other than that I don't have much positive things to say. The sheets I was given to make the bed was moist. The room was dirty and smelly. There was no aircon or fan and the room was superhot at night. I had booked a female dorm but was put in a mixed upon arrival (in the mixed room was only men at the time). The receptionist said that a request for female dorm is ""subject to availability"". It didn't say that on my booking and clearly they were unable to deliver what I actually had paid for. The receptionist was not handling my complaint in a good , he got irritated and was not customer-friendly at all. "
"12238","The proximity of the hotel to the beach is an advantage. One could easily have access to the beach and either swim in the sea or walk on the pavement along the beach. The interior of the hotel  is very good and comfortable. The staff is very friendly. The food is excellent. Certainly, in the future we will choose again Arsinoe Hotel for our short vacation. "
"12239","Helpfulness of the front desk personnell was great. Shuttleservice to outlet mall and "
"12240","Facilities, location with fantastic view. Good service in restaurant. "
"12241","It was the end of the season so we felt that some of the staff were rude and unhelpfull. This was at the beach and at the water park. "
"12242","The hotel parking is shared with hatten square, the parking was full during my check in time (maybe due to public holiday).  I was told to park at next building (mahkota hospital) and in evening to try parking again.    As such, suppose is free parking for guest but need to spend few hours for parking fees   additional time to manage this."
"12243","Found the staff very helpful, appreciate there help regard Taxies where I get one after stay with my sister.  Able to relax- nice.  Kindest Regards  Peter J Barr"
"12244","Brilliant location, short walk from the beach. We opted for one of the high level rooms on the corner which had a view of the sea. Very comfortable beds and lots of space. Would definitely stay again. "
"12245","Niggles only: having to pay for the safe but knew about this beforehand and had to hold the shower head as it was positioned at odd angle. "
"12246","Clean big room,very good breakfast,enjoyed our stay overall.peaceful and quiet.would definitely stay agin."
"12247","Bar restaurant was very slow in serving us,oder coming with half of what we ordered.food was ok but not happy with the service from the restaurant.wouldve been nice if there was air conditioning in our room."
"12248","Nice hotel for some days of relax.Also good food is served.Few meters away from the promenade and from the main square area."
"12249","The indoor pool is suppose to be part of the SPA facilities. Apart that it was over crowded, there was no supervision, very noisy and you have to be careful where to stay as someone might jump on you although it was not permitted to jump into."
"12250","Two lovely embaressed receptionist who tried to sort out the problems for us. oh and our free room upgrades if our where upgrades god knows what our initial rooms would of been like."
"12251","Firstly being told you only have one room when booked and paid for two is not a good start. on arrival and finding hotel you then need to walk to another hotel to check in. and if you want to eat the same applies. i personally will not be staying again. "
"12252","Very well communicated with the City Center with Metro Line 14 and also RER. Commuting takes only about 15-20 minuntes. Transport to Airport is also good. Rooms are correct with clean and new bathroom and confortable beds. Overall, very good value for the money if you are staying over the weekend or Bank Holidays since it is focued as business Hotel and I imagine fares go up strongly during week days. Considering the prices of hotels in Paris there this is probably one of the best options available"
"12253","The room needed painting around the window. There seemed to be some humidity problem that made the paint peel off. Probably due to lack of adequate ventilation"
"12254","Excellent in everything!!"
"12255","So close to the city !"
"12256","We arrived at 7 pm but had to wait to go to our room until 7.30 because the hotel staff had no record of our booking. I gave them the paperwork but they would not confirm the booking until they had made numerous calls to ensure that payment had been made. This in spite of having presented them with the print outs of both the booking and the receipt. We were not impressed and had to arrive late at a function."
"12257","Very friendly staff. Excellent location. "
"12258","Car parking in adjacent car parks is pricey. No reduced fees for hotel guests"
"12259","Terrible quality rooms, dirty, smelly, bugs and the phones didn't work"
"12260","Receptionist was very unfriendly and that set the tone for the stay. Very average hotel."
"12261","Hotel is central,  has its own taxi rank and the security staff at night make you feel safe. The rooms are well presented and ideal for a weekend away. The staff are polite and always willing to help. I have stayed here before and whenever visiting Newcastle in the future I will stay here. I would recommend the Jurys Inn hotels and use them where possible. "
"12262","Unexpensive, easy to find."
"12263","Leisure facilities were the best part. Pool steam room and jacuzzi lovely"
"12264","We had an incessant noise in our room, housekeeping came to check it out and consequently stunk our room out with the cig she must have just enjoyed! Springs in mattress non existant. Chunks of ladies hair in the showers by the pool even after the cleaner had been in. Jacuzzi didnt work on our second day there"
"12265","Good value for money; clean and comfortable for travelling with friends. Great pool"
"12266","Location is not ideal - you have to take a cab to go out (road outside not ideal for walking)  Didn't like the fact that the toilet and shower are separate  "
"12267","The beach and the room oke because of the rain we  feel desolated,  And have to move earlier"
"12268","The jaguzi didnt work, no coffee in the room, the machine was broke, some lamps where broke, also outsite in the  to the restaurant,  The garden flowers are exotic (alien) so the indigenus hummelbirds can feed themse6lf. And to led a cat free walking and eating the animals is very bad, so kill it!    With more creativety and renovation the is a good spot with good potention, the baech is great.  "
"12269","Location very good and the common areas are well taking care of."
"12270","The staff wasn't helpful because we had a problem with the reservation and they got angry at us on the phone. Also one waiter at the breakfast was very rude, he didn't want to put tables together for six people and made us feel uncomfortable. However the reception staff was friendly and helpful when asked about indications on how to go to Lisboa, Cascais or where to eat."
"12271","Mattress was awful had all the springs popping out I still have back pains now. "
"12272","We were extremely pleased with the Sunset Beach Club. Our room was spacious, clean and well appointed.  We were self catering and the kitchenette was well equiped, with fridge, small electric hob, oven, toaster, kettle, microwave and all necessary cutlery/crockery. The only thing we would comment on was the design of our room (8th floor) - there was a step up into the seperate bedroom, which although had a warning strip and permenant lighting, could possibly be a hazard.  "
"12273","Staff so friendly....especially the Restaurant staff..and couldn't do enough to help.  Beds very comfortable and we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.  Def would stay here again!!"
"12274","Bed was very uncomfortable and the 2 bedroom suite  didn't have an attached bathroom which made it very inconvenient. "
"12275","I booked the room by looking at the rooms on the website. The room we got was no what in any  the same as the pictures on the website. When we queries this we were told that the room we ordered was an upgrade free of charge but the staff member at reception gave us the option of moving into another room (standard room that we had booked). However again the room was in no  like we would have imagined. The fixtures and décor was outdated and did not resemble what we had imagined we would have booked into by looking at the website. I would prefer if the rooms were advertised on the website the  they are. Very disappointed with overall stay even with the room upgrade. May travel to Kinsale again but will look for alternative accommodation :("
"12276","Great location and facilities , friendly staff ."
"12277","Room was only cleaned on one occasion during our stay which was for one week . "
"12278","Our room had a seaview and was cleaned everyday and towels changed no complaints  The quality of food was excellent their was plenty of choice and you could always find something you like.  The staff were always very pleasant and helpful especially at reception.  The hotel facilities are excellent even a private secluded beach not far away  Have been twice would not hesitate to go back"
"12279","There was some virus going arround at  the time  my wife caught it but it did not spoil our holiday  This can be caused by one person carrying it and spreads due to large amounts of people   There were hand sanitisers available to sanitise anytime you wish  There was no problems with the food  or cleanliness in Hotel  Enteertainment was not very good except for the karaoke it was very good "
"12280","For what you are paying, you're getting excellent value. Neat, tidy, spacious rooms and a variety of cold meats and cheeses and pickles and eggs and fish and lots of other good things for breakfast. One of the few places that can make scrambled egg properly. Service very good, and staff extremely helpful and welcoming. The hotel’s only idiosyncrasy is the wobbly handrail up the stairs."
"12281","Poor booking in experience and rude reception staff"
"12282","I have already sent a review to you "
"12283","takes 30 mins to check in."
"12284","Central location, nice to be by the park, always plenty of taxis. Great view from park/harbour view rooms. Good to have wifi included in the rooms. The rooms were very clean and the cleaning staff Very  helpful and pleasant. Shuttle bus service was comfortable and good and the bell captain was very efficient and helpful with the luggage. Bar was comfortable, staff very pleasant and happy hour a bonus."
"12285","Lifts not adequate long waits, a nightmare at peak times. Room size small. We had requested a double non smoking room and paid for a park/harbour view. (We had booked 2 double rooms) The only. Double room available was smoking and up a flight of steps after the last lift floor and without a harbour view. We we're put in a smoking room with twin beds pushed together but the light  then stuck out over the bed and we kept banging our head on it we did have a harbour view if we could get to the window, the room was so cramped and unacceptable. When we complained we were told we could move to non smoking double rooms with harbour views the next day. We did move the next day, the staff were very helpful and the move went smoothly."
"12286","I would recomend this hotel to anyone. Facilities "
"12287","Good location, close to Rosehill Racecourse."
"12288","it was one of the best places ive ever stayed at , I recommend this for any kind of travellers "
"12289","Well situated........an easy walk to everywhere.  Helpful friendly staff, who even found me a phone charger in their cupboard !!!!! Also looked up bus times to Coto Donana Natural Park to make the day as successful as possible.  They managed to fit two of us in for an extra three days, after initially thinking they were full ."
"12290","We were warnly welcomed at the Bar Bensouda by the manager who couldn't have be more kiind, helpfull and accomodating.   This Riad is has been lovingly renovated respecting the local style yet offering lovely large rooms/baths right in the center of the Medina\!!! The Raids common rooms are big, open and inviting and the roof deck is worth a visit and a bit of time with a book and nibbles and wine. Great view  partuclarly at night.  Staff was friendly and accomodating. Breakfast were continental.   We had enjpyed our stay and I would hestiate to recommend it particularly to those wanting the full experience of the Medina!!!! "
"12291","The Fez Medina is located on a hill and this Riad is smack in the middle of the Medina so no matter which  you go you are eventually coming back up a hill. A bit of a challenage in the hot weather. It started  to feel like I was doing the Grouse Grind once a day. So not for the faint of heart or the infirm.    Expect to pay 10-20 Drh per trip to guides to get in and out of the Medina, its a rabbit warren of alleys and takes a while before you start to find your  back. "
"12292","The hotel staff couldnt do anymore for us ,really kind and helpful. The cleaner was so nice.I would stay there again close to everything."
"12293","Lovely room. Great location."
"12294","As we had an early morning flight, at check-in, I enquired as to whether there was a wedding being held that evening. As the answer was yes, I asked to be put in a room far away from any noise - which the receptionist said had been done. We were about 5 doors away from the main reception and wedding guests shouted, laughed, joked and slammed doors up and down the corridor until at least 1.30am. We had to get up at 4.30am. Noise not hotel's fault but we could have been placed somewhere else."
"12295","A very nice hotel away from the bustle of town. The breakfast was superb. Although dinner is not served, there is a little square about 20 metres from the front entrance with four fantastic and reasonably priced  restaurants. The rooms were excellent and the staff efficient yet friendly. The hotel had a quite luxurious ambience.  An unusual hotel, built on a hillside where the front entrance is on the top floor and most rooms below. A little gem!"
"12296","The car park is separate from the hotel and the main hotel entrance is a 50 yard hike up a steep hill. If you go into the car park first, you cannot get out on foot without knowing the code for the gate ( we luckily guessed 1234 and escaped.)   Best to go to the main entrance first, drop off any infirm members in your party and get the latest drill about the car park.  There needs to be clearer signs regarding the parking system for people like us who came across the car park before the hotel entrance.  There is a beautiful indoor pool but it is not heated and was too cold in October so empty."
"12297","1. Very centrally located around the major shopping malls!  2.  Accessories provided, e.g. good hairdryer "
"12298","1. Lifts seems to take forever to come  2. Queue for breakfast is very long.  3. Should have more rooms with double beds.  "
"12299","Did exactly what it said on the website. For what we paid we were very happy. Nice surprise was the small lounge area in the reception which had a TV and computer/internet access (pay as you go). Went down every morning to get a brew and it was reasonably priced, even got a cardboard cup carrier. Could leave luggage there before official check in for £2, which was a great help."
"12300","There is a small control panel (not sure what for) that has a green light on it in the room. This meant the room wasnt properly dark, but didnt cause a real issue.   Windowless room, gets very hot and stuffy. Need to ask staff to alter aircon settings so you can make your room go colder. Had to have it on all night which was a bit noisy. "
"12301","Staff very friendly and efficient. Good value for overnight stay."
"12302","Perfect location if you want a decent hotel without the cost of staying at a Port Aventura hotel. The Dorada Palace is a pleasant 15 min walk away from the theme parks. It is also only 5 mins to the beach."
"12303","Restaurant food is lacking in appeal but is edible.  This was the most disappointing aspect of our stay at this hotel but certainly not bad enough to prevent us staying here again."
"12304","Perfect location for what we wanted.  Friendly, clean all facilities as promised.  We will definitely go back"
"12305","Quiet garden with pool although pool very cold .nice sitting out area for meals.buffet food mostly good.design of hotel is attractive . Rooms quite spacious and good value for money,particularly half board.Worth taking even if eating out occasionally."
"12306","Standard of food and service can fall when there are groups in the hotel.centre is a taxi ride away and requires bargaining for fare."
"12307","- Almost a 10 minute walk from the city center  - Lovely Indian restaurant (Bombay Masala) opposite the hotel  - Friendly "
"12308","- Pricing was ridiculous - I was asked to pay extra for the internet, which is not acceptable in 2013 !!!  - Breakfast was average - limited choices for vegetarians  - Overall pricing is high compared to competitors (within ½km radius), i did check "
"12309","Fantastic location! Apartment was exactly as described "
"12310","None! But could do with cereal bowls in apartment as had to use a cup! Restaurant was closed as visited at end of the season - but these are just comments for hotel to see, certainly not negatives!"
"12311","No own private beach"
"12312","It was a perfect gateway for me and my partner-removed from the hustle "
"12313","The only problem was the access card when coming back into the  room took minutes to open. The toilet "
"12314","Quite near to Kuah town and Jetty. Ample of parking space. "
"12315","The room not vacuumed especially the sofa and carpet floor. The breakfast was nightmare as insufficient space to sit (some forced to eat standing) and run out of food easily. We skipped the 2nd day breakfast as no place to sit. "
"12316","The rooms are big but looks a bit old.  Food was good and serving time was good too. Swimming pool with children facilities is excellent"
"12317","Minimum kitchen facilities. No cutlerries. Should have door mat or slippers."
"12318","The food was great. i especially loved the breakfast as there was so much choice.  The hotel's located in a very quiet environment surrounded by nature making it ideal as a getaway from busy city life.  "
"12319","I was very disappointed with the  the reception staff as well as their Manager handled my booking. They could not verify my booking stating that there had not been any information exchange between themselves and hotelopia. In fact they claimed not to know about hotelopia and so suspected I had not made the payment. My family and I were made to wait for over 45 minutes before we could be allocated a room. I was very inconvenienced and never even got an apology for this when they eventually verified my booking. "
"12320","Low speed in the room with internet connection"
"12321","Good price and breakfast. Tidy though small. A number of restaurants around."
"12322","Staff do not speak English. They are not attentive and professional to customers' request."
"12323","Lovely rooms , sweet staff (very nice cleaning ladies), plentyful breakfast. Loved staying there!"
"12324","The MUSE Pub on the ground floor was pumping out music at full volume on Saturday and Monday nite when we were trying to sleep 2 floors above. The music could have been half the loudness. We had a 4am flight to catch on 5/11 and as a result of the MUSE club got very little sleep. I would not stay at this hotel again."
"12325","location and friendly staff"
"12326","unfortunately saw a cockroach in the restaurant and in-room"
"12327","We found the staff really pleasant and professional."
"12328","convenient location   helpful staff   clean room"
"12329","internet charge applies  room tax, additional 24 euro not disclosed at time of booking"
"12330","A little far out of Dubrovnik.  Staff would ask you to vacate dining room when food service is over, also when having a drink on the terrace our glasses were taken from us and we felt obliged to leave the terrace area as early as ten pm.  "
"12331","Clean and very professional and serviceminded staff"
"12332","Had booked 2 two bedroom apartments and only 1 came up on check in front desk staff took quite some time to find another apartment and did not explain what he was doing while i waited."
"12333","The staff is very kind and helpfull,"
"12334","This was our 3 stay in this hotel but also our last. Is seems as there wasn't anu maintenance since last year, it is is overall in a poor state.   After a week our bed looked cleaned, but it wasn't clean...we got bedbugs...!!!  (Yes, we became another room without any discussion.)  The breakfast wasn't good as before, it was everyday the same, Not enough yoghurt, only a few days some fruit but not enough for everyone. Coffee and hot water should be available during the hole day,,,often cold and the water was like coffee...    "
"12335","Near the train station with many restaurants around. Nice staff. Nice bathroom."
"12336","Very bad reception from the receptionist. Not helpful at all"
"12337","Really value for money even though the hotel is quite old. Even they have a bathtub in the bathroom. Will definitely stay there again,"
"12338","Quite far from the town centre"
"12339","Fabulous position, beautifully maintained with exemplary, courteous and attentive service.    Fabulous!!"
"12340","impractical. No shelf in the bathroom and a microwave in the kitchen. No irons and ironing boards."
"12341","Staff were more than helpful and very friendly, nothing too much trouble  Room was very large and clean, with good views.  Plenty of wardrobe space and separate toilet from bathroom was ideal.  Ideal situated right next to beach and shops and restaurants. Within walking distance of most places.  Breakfast times were brilliant from 5am-11am."
"12342","The lift doors did not give you chance to get in or out, especially with a wheelchair, and on a number of occasions doors shut and had to go up to the next floor before getting to relevant floor.  No coffee or tea making facilities in room, Breakfast was varied, but all food was only luke warm. Normally most hotels serve you tea/coffee at your table but not here.  The pool was absolutely freezing so therefore unable to venture into the pool.  No entertainment or information on hotel facilities, only facility was pool. Would not rate this as a 5 star hotel.  "
"12343","No positive revieew i will recommends no body lives here"
"12344","very dirty room, and dirty floors, no value for money, no air condition and when asked about it I was told that all rooms do not have a/c. no good breakfast, nothing nearby."
"12345","Horrible, dirty, smelly, noisy, depressing dump."
"12346","Baggage handling excellent from taxi to check in.  We arrived early, thus room not available for several hours which is a bit of a drag, however, is understandable.    Once room available after 2 hours, all went well.  Mine was a quiet room, thus no complaints."
"12347","I believe in this day and age, wi-fi facilities should be available in all rooms, and also at no charge."
"12348","Stayed at Cay Beach with my 17year old son for a 5night self catering holiday. Hotel was very good, clean and with good facilities. Staff at reception were friendly and very helpful.  I haven't rated food as we were self catering.  Only comment to improve facilities would be to extend gym opening hours beyond 5pm to 7/8pm when we would have preferred to use it."
"12349","It's cheap, and the location isn't too bad. The staff are friendly and quite helpful."
"12350","Some of the staff were amazing. "
"12351","Nice hotel, clean rooms, friendly staff."
"12352","It is close to Cenang beach, looks new and have wide car park"
"12353","Room insulation is not good, could hear people spoke loudly. Got mosquitoes in room. Pillow provided is limited and room not big. Breakfast choice was horribly, like eating vege only, till have to go out cross the road to take local food. The appearance of breakfast also not attractive, not worth for money. If want to stay this hotel, better take without breakfast, do not waste money. The service in room also slow, requested for making up, until 6pm also did not clean up. While towel not being renewed. When request, staff said not yet dry and will send later. Till check out also never being delivered with new towel. Not a good hotel, discourage. "
"12354","Location (close of shops, RER Stationa and Disney Shuttle Bus Service)  The One Bedroom Units are good for two people (not for four)"
"12355","The Studio rooms are cramped  The Studio Beds are settee beds"
"12356","Good location, Close to the old town.. Spacious and clean rooms. All in all a good hotel."
"12357","The day I arrived Hotel got a booking from the office in Bangkok said that I have only one room booked which definately wrong. I made the reservation 2 weeks in advance for 2 rooms with 3 adults. For some reasons they got me only a room and the hotel staff do not capable of fix the problem."
"12358","Fantastic food! Much activities all day round."
"12359"," The hotel had a fresh modern appearance. It was conveniently situated 10 minutes walk from the central station and in close proximity to many of the key sites of interest."
"12360","Marble in the bathroom and near the hot drinks facilities in the room could have been polished more vigilantly."
"12361","Fantastic location value for money nice Bailinese hotel with very friendly smiling staff. Will stay there again."
"12362","Great location, easy fast check in, read some reviews on line that were very picky. We were very happy with our stay. Stayed during Melb cup week. The place is slightly dated but room was nice and big and clean and comfortable we were very pleasantly surprised. Would definitely stay again."
"12363","Lift a little slow and some of the bulbs behind the buttons broken"
"12364","The facilities were good and the environment was excellent. "
"12365","Upon Arrival at the reception, the staff ignored us for awhile before speaking without lifting up their heads to welcome us. i found this annoying as it is suppose to be a 4 star hotel."
"12366","Although old and a bit tired in places, it is a classic beautiful building."
"12367","Staff varied from upbeat and polite to downbeat and polite."
"12368","Is a long  out of the city centre. Hotel would not order us a minicab either"
"12369","Really nice hotel in a silent sorrounding, away from the centre where you can rest and enjoy the beauty of Falesia Beach. Good connections to main roads if you want to rent a car and travel through Algarve. Friendly staff, clean rooms, cheap price for accommodation - everything's perfect!"
"12370","Really nice hotel close to the centre, but where you can rest and enjoy the beauty of nearby beaches like Marinha. Good connections to main roads if you want to rent a car and travel through Algarve. Friendly staff, clean rooms, cheap price for accommodation - everything's perfect!"
"12371","Great value for money. Near to the beach, Wallmart (if u need 2 buy groceries), city centre and shopping mall. Friendly staff, complimentary breakfast. Clean, freshly decorated rooms; fridge in the room."
"12372","Very small swimming pool area but hotel supply u with beach club entry in Cabo Villas. Try it- it's great...just take some id in order to rent beach towels."
"12373","Location,quiet area,sun all day if you get a room facing to the south/the sea.Value for the money."
"12374","Not up to date facilities,you have to pay extra for wi-fi,television.Lack of maintenance. Furniture is worn,bad and noisy beds.  Some traffic noise around the pool."
"12375","I was very impressed with all of the staff they were helpful, informative and very happy professionals. The room was very well appointed and the bed probably the most comfortable I've slept in. The continental breakfast was excellent with a superb selection of fruit.  Only slight grumble was the lack of fresh vegetables for my personal taste on the dinner menu.  Many thanks for a wonderful stay "
"12376","        Charged a daily fee of $14.00. Ridiculous just another  to rip people off, I got in at 1a.m. And left at 7!      "
"12377","Loved the rooms as always when I stop at the Raddison Blu with a good view of the river"
"12378","I have only given a score of 3 for value as the room was acceptable for a city centre hotel but the car parking was very very expensive £20 per night. In future I would look for somewhere else with either discounted or free parking when visiting Liverpool again."
"12379","Simple, but clean room. Really nice and helpful staff!"
"12380","Perfect for a weekend stay, central location with most things within walking distance.  Staff very professional and helpfull.   When back in Dublin we will be staying at this hotel again."
"12381","Very outdated. The current were dirty. Stains everywhere. Even when the maid cleaned she kept the dirty sheets on the bed. "
"12382","Lovely view over the harbour"
"12383","Too many stairs , carpets  badly stained in rooms, hotel needs upgrade to be class a 5 stars "
"12384","Food disgusting. Lots of foul mouthed contractors boozing it up. Poor on-site parking."
"12385","Hotel is outstanding, so futuristic. I recommend the plasma room. I didnt comment on value for money due to bar prices. "
"12386","Ridiculous expensive bar. £37 euro for 2 gin n tonic.   Mini bar in room has a great selection but only if your willing to pay a fortune.  Go to local supermarket "
"12387","staff friendly, tried their best to help and please"
"12388","I have read some bad reviews of this hotel, but found no real problems. Room was spacious and clean. Television was quite old, and not many channels available. Bathroom ok. The breakfast included was fairly basic; if I remember properly, think it was 2 eggs "
"12389","good location, spacious room, well equiped."
"12390","Had a room in basement - very poor signage which was irritating but not a major issue.  Bed was of poor quality, it creaked badly all night and the mattress was uncomfortable, pillows not good either - attention to these issues woudl tranform the experience."
"12391","The best hotel ever"
"12392","The hotel is really good location for Disney as you can catch the ART buses to Disneyland.  It's two blocks away so it's easier to get an ART bus pass.  Good location to food stores as well.  I was really impressed about room size.  It's a really good value hotel.  They can even look after your luggage on your checkout day as well.  I would definitely recommend staying there.  "
"12393","The only negative about the hotel is that sometimes the hot water takes a while to come through to the west side of the building.  "
"12394","Excellent location if you don't want to stay right in the city centre. Very close to metro station just around the corner. Also very close to a very large shopping centre called Diagonal Mar which had many different restaurants on the top floor. Rooms are of a good size and very clean. Will definitely stay here if I return to Barcelona."
"12395","-Breakfast staff and bell boys helpful and friendly.  -American breakfast good.  -Great view of downtown and southbeach (our room)."
"12396","-A/C is noisy and wakes you up in the night when auto activated for cooling.  -Also unidentified noise from the outside which resulted in a sleepless night. Request for other room was granted and second room was less noisy from the outside.There seemed to be no real understanding at the frontdesk about the noise complaint. Therefore I consider this issue not properly solved.   -Rooms need to be renovated to meet the high standard Hilton quality.    Complaints were discussed with Front Office manager. Renovation seems to be scheduled for next year. "
"12397","10 min. walking to the train station, near to Little India.  Comfortable, very clean, nice pool, nice gym."
"12398","Very bad wifi, really bad."
"12399","-As a guest of this hotel you can use the beach facilities of the Ritz-Carlton beach resort using a shuttle service.  -Self parking facilities as well as valet parking.  -All staff friendly and helpful. "
"12400","location is good, and BF is good."
"12401","Staff was very helpful, meeting all of my requests efficiently and competently..  The breakfast buffet was exceptional."
"12402","Being right across from the train station was great. They also provided us with a transit pass and good information. English wasn't a problem. Breakfast was good. Hotel was clean. Switzerland is expensive so good value for money is relative.  "
"12403","Quiet and comfortable hotel. Wireless internet available in the lobby and restaurant. "
"12404","Basic breakfast was very expensive. One member of staff at checkout was unfriendly."
"12405","The location was briliant, close to everything and very easy to get around."
"12406","The musty mould smell in the first room we were given,requested a change of rooms and the first 2 front counter staff were very unhelpful. After waiting 2 hours for them to get back to me I finally escalated to the duty manager and we got moved within 15 minutes.  The second room was nicer but the bathroom was very small. The whole hotel has a musty damp smell all the  through it."
"12407","Very friendly and helpfull staff. Good cleaning of room. Nice rooms with plenty space."
"12408","Entry to parking place quite difficult."
"12409","Great hotel in a good location with an ace concierge called Marina.  She was enormously helpful and recommended two excelent restaurants."
"12410","  Have just compliments thoughts to convey reachability of this hotel everything from service to the supply of food and dryck.Bra facilities for kids with water park and games room with various games and bowling.Hade a great family vacation."
"12411","Value for money. friendly and helpful staff. Convenient to city centre"
"12412","Takes a while to get the lift"
"12413","Warm staff, easy communication, efficient service. Breakfast opened earlier for those of us with very early flights."
"12414","Except the rooms everything SAS nicej"
"12415","Hard and bad beds"
"12416","The hotel was comfortable and the room we were in had 2 sun-drenched balconies; breakfast at the other hotel was plentiful and delicious as usual"
"12417","Stunning view from our waterfront apartment. Handy for eating places and bus stops to Valetta or up the coast. "
"12418","Very clean, pleasant and helpful staff and the rooms were really comfortable and well presented, they had everything that I required. 5/5"
"12419","Very friendly staff. our seavieuw bungalow was excellent and we stayed there fot the third time. Candi Dasa is a perfect place for exploring the real Bali . There are several good restaurants and White sand beach is lovely and only a 10 minutes drive from Candi Dasa. The hotel has a nice pool with seavieuw to relax."
"12420","Great Location for Nia and Canal side"
"12421","None really"
"12422","This hotel is definitely not a boutique hotel. The pictures on the website are a far cry from reality. This hotel is in dire need of a renovation. It is NOT worth the USD 150,-- per night. I was very disappointed and will not stay there again, unless they do an entire overhaul."
"12423","The hotel is amazing! It is an incredible building and setting and you feel to be set back in time. The staff was very friendly and the food was very good. All in all a very nice stay - almost like in a fairy tale."
"12424","The rooms are a bit outdated. One can say it fits into the flair, but they could do with some new refurbishment."
"12425","I booked well in advance and got an excellent rate, especially as it included breakfast.  15 minutes walk to the NEC means you can leave your car in the carpark and not pay the NEC rates.  Breakfast was good, decent selection and the hot food regularly replaced.  Free Wifi was decent enough."
"12426","Lovely spacious hotel, friendly staff and great location for NEC."
"12427","The hotel was lovely. Very friendly, yet professional staff, lovely clean rooms and lovely food, an excellent breakfast."
"12428","Excellent value for money and right near the MetroMover station"
"12429","Location is good.  Some of the staff are very formative, but some certainly need more training.  Future guests should be informed that the Princess "
"12430","Although the rooms were very clean, the bathrooms are very very old.  I had trouble turning the shower on and also the water wasn't going down the drain.  I had to call housekeeping, who came to check and in turn had to call a plumber to rectify the situation.  Internet very poor and non existant sometimes in the room.  This should not happen considering its part on the daily Resort Fee charge."
"12431","Pretty clean, cheap, warm welcome, convenient locations"
"12432","Room not well maintained, night stand had shelf half hanging off of it and one of the beds coverlay had stain on it."
"12433","Hotel rooms are definitely not 5 star.  If you have stayed at other 5 star all inclusive resorts you will definitely be disappointed with Ersan Resort.  Rooms are small and claustrophobic feeling.  When I arrived it was raining and food was serves separate location to drinks which was one floor away I was told to go get my drinks myself.    I made a note in the booking that is was our anniversary nothing was arranged.  When I mentioned all this to customer relations nothing was done.   Food there is alot of variety but nothing worth eating as it all does not taste any good.  Not all water slides were open and the ones that were were a rough ride.    Me and my family were very disappointed with this resort."
"12434","Poor Hotel Room, reasons:  1) Small room  2) Bathroom door would not close  3) Went to bed at 10pm the first night, could not sleep due to - 1. The noise of the next door shower being used. 2. The noise from the toilet flush in the room upstairs. 3. The noise from next door. I GOT TO SLEEP AT 1.30AM!  4) The next morning 9am, I was woken up by painters in the lobby outside my room (loud talking and joking). I asked myself who at the hotel (management) authorised this painting and decorating at this time in the morning!   5) No pen and pad provided. I expect 4* hotels to provide a pen and small pad in the room. Kensington close seems to be an exception, when I called guest services the lady kindly advised the hotel don't provide.    I spent a little over £200 for a double room two night stay, I expected something in return!.    Dont spend your money here, go elsewhere.    I won't be staying again."
"12435","Santa Isabel was the first of the small private hotels in Old Havana.  It is situated in Place des Armes, which was the first square to be built in Havana.  It is absolutely in the right place.  The open courtyard (which does not have music constantly playing unlike some other places) in the centre of the hotel is a lovely place in which to enjoy a drink and the bar is excellent with prices that are normal for the area.  Almost all the rooms have a patio and look  the square, which has a daily market of second-hand books (in many languages) and other memorabilia. I really cannot think of a better place to stay in Old Havana."
"12436","Good location close to the subway."
"12437","Breakfast : You could barely finish eating before you were asked to go"
"12438","Thought the breakfast was pretty good and not a bad variety of food   Handy to the train line   affordable    "
"12439","centrally located to kl sentral and monorail station"
"12440","old fashioned rooms - stained towels -lousy breakfast - worst of all on check out we were asked to wait while a security guy went up to the room to check if we did steal sth. like s/o would steal their dirty towles - disgusting!"
"12441","* tax charged at the end of our stay at hotel (4 euro per person/day), no clear information about that at accomodation time  * no bar at the hotel; after breakfast ( after 10 a.m.) no possibility to drink tea in the hotel; coffee from vending machine at main lobby only "
"12442","Excellent hotel no faults had a brilliant time would recommend highly."
"12443","Good beds, nice clean room, breakfast is OK, very close to Blue Mosk, Aya Sofia and the Grand Bazaar. Quiet street. friendly personel, very helpfull. The roof terrace is very nice to have breakfast with a beautiful view!     "
"12444","just a suggestion, breakfast could be more international maybe. Not veryebody loves olives, tomatos etc. in the morning   bathroom smells a little, I think this is a general problem "
"12445","nice hotel,   beautiful view sea,and city  good food,  nice staff  good location"
"12446","things outside urgently need to be refreshed (seats and  more parasols at pool), stairs to sea, platform, utilities downstairs near the sea"
"12447","Ptarmigan was perfect. We were visiting from Australia and the position was central to everything and everywhere. Staff were lovely and helpful. We will definitely be back. Thank you for a perfect holiday"
"12448","Nice beach, nice room in bungalow"
"12449","Too many drunk people, also seen one puking in swiming pool"

"12453","Clean and roomy accommodation, friendly staff"

"12457","Staff very welcoming "
"12458","Reliable Lifts would be really good"
"12459","Rooms and bathrooms a decent size, and our room request for twin beds was accommodated with no issues. Superb breakfast and very efficient, courteous staff throughout the hotel. The location is excellent with some great eateries close by."
"12460","Even though the hotel is on the older side, some areas particularly in the bedroom are a bit shabby(particularly the woodwork)"
"12461","Had wonderful stay in hotel, staff friendly and v efficient  Will definitely be back :)"
"12462","Underground carpark is not fun!!!"
"12463","Great location for all parks. Good parking. Great views over lake. Nice big pool. Helpful staff on desk and ticket sales desk."
"12464","Only got cleaned once. Were booked for two cleans but second one never happened."
"12465","the bus transfer (free) from the hotel to the city and back, and also from en to the airport!  the friendly staff.  "
"12466","the rooms are very noisy, you could hear the neighbours speak and do other things..."
"12467","A very nice and clean hotell.  The rooms very good.  The breakfast, we did not miss anything on the tables!  If we og to Warszawa again we will use this hotell."
"12468","I'm never the kind to give bad reviews but I would not feel right with myself knowing information and not sharing it. So I will break down each area:  I've been in many of resorts and I am accustomed to all of the fees but just be aware that you will pay a resort fee ($18.00), suite tax (3.00) outside of the base prices and all other taxes that were included on the site. The problem I have is paying a resort fee that goes to the property but isn't maintained as well as a 4 star resort should be maintained. I paid a suite tax towards a suite that had water damage on the ceilings, dirty grout on floor and shower and a refrigerator that I couldn't use because if I break the seal to store personal items, you will be charged. Also, just be prepared that on top of all that they hold 100.00 on your card and not released days later. so you pay 200 total plus a night (discounted price) for a suite that is outdated, an elevator that reaks of something indescribable and parts of the grounds that's not kept to the standard of what it should be. I've honestly had a better room and stay at a regular hotel for less than what I paid this weekend. I'm still disappointed 2 days later."
"12469","£100 security bond fee is ridiculous considering the overall cost for the night was £49 between 3 of us. "
"12470","Great staff , Great hotel, Great location nice and quiet definitely nice hotel to relax."
"12471","my only problem here was the room service glasses weren't polished which had water marks which didn't  look good. Also the sliver cover to keep the food warm had the same water marks it seems like they never polish them. plus my morning breakfast was cold."
"12472","excellent staff. very clean with the maid service everyday. Excellent location and excellent pool facilities. "
"12473","Outdated and in need of an reburbishment"
"12474","lots of prizes and great cost for food at buffet."
"12475","smoke smell is very heavy inside the casino."
"12476","Good Hotel with a very convenient location. We took the free shuttle to KLIA then a 10 Ringitt express bus to KL Sentral for  dinner in Little India. We will use this Hotel again."
"12477","Beautiful lobby. Rooms were nice with comfy beds and pillows. We had a nice view of the pool and the golf course. The staff were very friendly and accommodating."
"12478","We had bed bugs in our bed!!! I felt itchy the first night. When i woke up the next morning I saw a bug and killed it immediately. I called housekeeping and they sent someone who collected the bug and put it in a plastic bag. They said they would change the sheets and fumigate the room. I wanted to change rooms but unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked.  I still felt itchy the following nights. When I got back home, I counted 34 bites on my body, which was located mostly on my arm and neck area.  I didn't expect this from a 5 star hotel!!!"
"12479","You have to climb 3 flights of stairs to get to the front door of the hotel  Some staff members were not pleasant to talk to  Breakfast listed as 7-10:30 but they were never ready before 7:30 and kept us waiting with no apology."
"12480","Nice hotel in a good location."
"12481","There was something wrong with the floorboards. They were incredibly loud so when the people would walk in the room above me, it actually woke me up. I could even hear it through my earplugs.   I was also disappointed to not have a bathtub.  They also did not follow their own towel policy where you don't wash them if hung up. I find this annoying as they claim to do their part for the environment but they don't really..."
"12482","Great price for place that is no frills but still relatively comfortable. Good budget choice for those wishing to do it cheap. "
"12483","Its pretty old and worn out"
"12484","Breakfast is only bacon and egg and some toast! No ham / cheese at all.  "
"12485","The hotel was clean and the location is near enough most areas around Union Square that you can easily walk 4-10 blocks to find some great places to eat and event venues."
"12486","The room is quite small, pricey, and very few amenities. There was also dust in the air that made it a little difficult to stay in the room for long periods of time. "
"12487","I booked a family during midterm break when we arrived no family room available instead they gave us 2 rooms."
"12488","DREAM HOLIDAY    During our stay (26 october-3 november), every single day of our vacation has been of sun "
"12489","Very comfortable 1 night stay, easy reach of the airport.  "
"12490","Crockery mugs and plates would be better than polystyrene when heating up soup!"
"12491","It is not good that WI-FI is extra in a business hotel. That was the only negative point."
"12492","Very convenient location for quick Metro access to Kiev City Centre.    Comfortable beds."
"12493","Clean Room, good services, nice food"
"12494","Location. Does not have any malls within it 1km radius "
"12495","we have stayed at the hotel several times before and understand that it is a two star hotel therefore our expectations have been according. the rooms have been clean and the staff always friendly and willing to help. we use the hotel as a weekend getaway."
"12496","after this weekends experience we will defiantly not be returning again!!! the room was small, no bath, bathroom was dirty the carpet full of tea stains. there were tea making facilities but no tea bags/sugar or milk. the noise from the toilet flush/shower from the room above was incredibly loud (louder than the ones in our own room) which kept us awake during the night and very early in the morning. having stayed several times before this will defiantly be the last. we were left wondering if these rooms were allocated specifically for the hotelopia as it was the first time we used this site. i do hope not!!"
"12497","Had a problem with room allocation ( booked 5 but only got down as 1 ) but soon resolved, excellent staff, spotlessly clean, relaxed atmosphere, breakfast plentiful and relaxed, will be using again"
"12498","Delighted with our stay in the Carlton. Finally we've found a hotel in Dublin that we actually like! Staff delightful, room perfect, and about the same price as other hotels that were nowhere near as pleasant. We'll be coming back here."
"12499","Good value for money in central location"
"12500","The lunch and breakfast were very good"
"12501","Despite asking 3 times had  1 milk despite 3 people  in room  No towel and facecloths  Stinky drain in basin and bathroom is open plan  Extractor not working in toilet   Outside seating sofas filthy, I wouldn't sit there.  Although in decor industry not impressed with complete look of hotel, my son asked if we staying here  because  its cheap as iindustrial look a bit  shabby"
"12502","I have to give top ratiung in every category for this hotel. Whilst the room was clearly ""budget"", they are priced accordingly and are therefore excellent for the money. The customer service: this is a family run hotel and the husband and wife team made us so welcome. They were always helpful and friendly and I felt they would do their very best to make our stay a good one. We had a first floor sea view room with balcony, and with the marina and the mountains outside this was lovely. The Eolo is at the very centre of the town, so several restaurants and cafes were just a few steps away. We came on a cycling holiday and the owner was happy for us to lock our bikes up near the reception desk; he was also interested in and encouraging about our rides!"
"12503","Nothing is negative about this hotel given the great service and price, however guests should decide what they want from their hotel. We wanted somewhere very central and at a good price. Central means some road noise, some noise from people when the bars turn out, and also noise as the street cleaners work in the early morning. All this is fine by me as we want to be at the centre of things, and we enjoy the smaller independent type of hotel. If you want quiet, go for an out of town hotel, of which there are several. You may get bigger and better rooms, a pool, and many more in-house facilities than at the Eolo; you will also pay a lot more and have to walk/bus/taxi into town."
"12504","Parking was very convenient and was in a good location? Receptionist on 2nd was slightly more friendly."
"12505","The hotel reception were not very welcoming when we arrived.  During the night my boyfriend was unwell and receptionist would only give me 1 small bottle of water which I had to pay for.  "
"12506","bedroom to hot and when opened window was very noisy were at front of hoell"
"12507","Great ability of the staff to adapt to the guest demands. Good quality standards. Very convenient hotel IF you have to attend any event in Yas Island, only IF."
"12508","It might sound silly but not having automatic doors to get into the hotel in the outter layer it makes the guest a little difficult to deal with the baggage and the glass door"
"12509","Amazing hotel ! Great view, location, nice staff."
"12510","Clean, spacious, modern, convenient location, friendly and very helpful staff."
"12511","Nothing negative at all "
"12512"," first time I have stayed there. from checkin to leaving all staff very polite.rooms very clean "
"12513","It can be a bit noisy as the walls are quite thin and the rooms either face the bars area or the main street. No sleepers neither gowns in the room."
"12514","friendly staff , clean and modern hotel in a convenient area within walking distance to Camden market and the tube station . Overall a pleasant stay and would definitely return in the future ."
"12515","Very convenient place for shopping in Leeds. Love the swimming pool and leisure facilities. Staff always pleasant and helpful. I have been many times before and probably think that this is the best hotel to stay in the city centre of Leeds."
"12516","To be nit picking I found the decor in the rooms somewhat dowdy. I suppose it was chosen for a businessman's stay, it was very masculine, and there were a few grubby marks on the wall.   My biggest bug bear was the restaurant. My 2 daughters and granddaughter arrived for breakfast. There was no one to direct us to our seats, so we just sat down, and waited, and waited, so we decided to just help ourselves as it was a buffet, but we still wanted tea and coffee, which required someone to serve us. We had to ask 3 times before we actually got any.  We came to the conclusion that if we were down and out in Leeds this would be a great place to come, because nobody asked us for our room number for payment. As it was we had already paid. There needs to be someone in overall charge of the guests when they arrive, and that they are attended to. There weren't any plates, the cereal bowls ran out., it just wasn't properly organised.  The breakfast however, was very good. The fried eggs were very nice, which is difficult in large quantities.  Just not organised properly."
"12517","Great location for shopping, visiting, airport. Very friendly and professional staff. Ideal. "
"12518","The room had a great view of Downtown Disney and Epcot.  It is an easy walk to Downtown Disney."
"12519","The room we had a funky smell and the carpet hadn't been vacuumed.  Also, the beds are double, so they are small."
"12520","Good price for room, but I eoyldnt probably go for updated rooms if staying for a week"
"12521","when we arrived the receptionist welcomed us at the door in a friendly and welcoming manner. everywhere was clean. I was made up with the fact there was parking.   single rooms are a tad small but they suited us as we only needed a bed to sleep in as we were out all day and gone straight after breakfast. the twin room was good size but my son found the ceiling and doorways a little low as they were in attic but again they were very clean."
"12522","breakfast was ok, but we were disappointed that a full English was advertised but it was only a sausage an egg rasher of bacon some beans and mushrooms, cerial was available and there was fruit juice toast.tomatoes and hash brown would have bulked out the full English. "
"12523","This Hotel is located about 20 minutes from HEATHROW  AIRPORT Terminals 1,2,3 BUS 285.  Terminal 4 "
"12524","Hotel is in process of renovating some floors."
"12525","I booked double room n I given twin room, room was not cleaned, including bed shit, wash room was extremely dirty n no heater or ac working n bad odour in room, floor tiles was not clean, toilet in very bad condition   I won't recommend this hotel I saw some nice n clean hotel near by beach  Never go to this hotel again "
"12526","Our room was very clean. They made special accommodations for a family member with medical issues. They did a great job. Parking was good. Good hotel for Anaheim convention center. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. "
"12527","It is a small hotel, so the fitness center, pool were small. The staff were young and slightly unprofessional, but very helpful and accommodating. "
"12528","Lovely room with balcony overlooking beach. Inclusive breakfast was lovely! Evening bar guy was very friendly and helpful. "
"12529","Aircon in room was very intermittent, had to ask reception to call maintenance twice.  "
"12530","Attention by staff excellent at all times."
"12531","Water not always hot enough for a bath in early evening."
"12532","The rooms need makeover"
"12533","Central, easy to. Quick check in/out process. Quiet room despite being in the middle of Broad Street.  Value for money."
"12534","Breakfast  - eating area was only a little better than a Little Chef and if you have been to one of those recently thats not a high compliment. When I phoned to ask about car parking the receptionist found it hard to explain how to get to car park, kind had to figure it out for myself."
"12535","warm and friendly on arrival, helped with all my needs, nice to have car parking provision, even at £5.00 per night was money well spent"
"12536","the restaurant has funny opening times and not much of a menu"
"12537","Very new with nice design "
"12538","Noisy air vent. But staff tried to do something about it. But all rooms had problem"
"12539","Very cheap price, and there is everything you need. "
"12540","The staff were very nice and very very helpful.  The location was great for wandering around, not far from the center but parking still available.  Breakfast was good and the pool looked nice although we didn't go swimming."
"12541","If you're looking for character, this probably isn't the best choice.  Also if you're a light sleeper bring some earplugs because sound travels like crazy- footsteps on the tile floor as well as water in the pipes."
"12542","Central location , well organised hotel and food was great"
"12543","No air con in hotel so need to keep patio doors open at night . Often woken up by noise on the street in the early hrs ."
"12544","Good value, decent location, ideal for access to central Dublin and the Aviva Stadium."
"12545","After reading some comments I was a bit worried until I arrived there the hotel was very clean rooms were lovely and we were greated with smiling faces and booked in with ease restaurant staff were always helpful and you could have a laugh with them.wine in restaurant was brilliant you serve yourself out of bottles which was really good tried to book for two weeks in July but was told fully booked no spaces at all hotel must of been 3/4 full and yet service was not altered "
"12546","Very clean and fresh. Contemporary decor. Felt safe and secure (the city is very dangerous, do not under estimate!). Fellow guests are professional respectable people."
"12547","Very close to NEC, Birmingham International Airport and Train station. Hotel has ample car parking facility. Also, has a good restaurant."
"12548","Ideal location for stay before our cruise. Near to cruise bus pickup point. Short walk to La Rambla and easy metro access to other points of interest. Very helpful staff."
"12549","We were on the first floor and the only view from the window was of a  high quadrangle of walls and windows of other rooms so felt the need to keep window "
"12550","good location"
"12551","Nothing is hoped ... except sleep."
"12552","I had a happy stay. The room was small but I only spent the nights there. I slept with an open window.There was no excessive street noise which kept me awake. The breakfast was a pleasant surprise - quite a variety.  The location is good - near the central city and near transport routes. I found the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful and will surely recommend this hotel to other travellers."
"12553","Great Hotel and for my 2 day stopover, excellent location for BUs services to/ from HEATHROW Airport.  Train to London.  Hotel located 20 minutes from Airport on 285 bus from T3."
"12554","No omments"
"12555","Close to railway station - about 20 steps door to door  Extremely comfortable bed  Clean room of adequate size  Efficient reception"
"12556","Be careful when parking - hotel car park is NOT well signed, even though I was given instruction by reception I accidentally parked in station parking area and had to pay (an exorbitant sum!)  Might have been too many staff in the breakfast room so actually less efficient service than it might have been - things were cleared away before they were finished!  Coffee was brought to the table ready made in a cup - no choice given as to style of coffee preferred  Two faults in room - very noisy bathroom fan and room centre light not working"
"12557","good value bed very confortable shuttle bus to airport"
"12558","Hotel staff all very good . All polite and helpful . Hotel location was great and easy parking at rear .  Rooms adequate allthough small and breakfast was excellent quality .  The hotel had a lovely feel about it being a charming old building with lots of character . A beautiful real fire in the reception/lounge was always alight creating a warm cosy atmosphere . No major complaints at all ."
"12559","No negative reviews just a few suggestions . At breaklfast the tea/coffee service was slow , NOT the fault of the restaurant staff , perhaps leave a pot on the table for the guest . Also i was carrying alot of luggage due end of trip abroad , very difficult negotiating lots of stairs to room ."
"12560","Ideal location for everything! Easy to get to shops "
"12561","The only negative I have would be regarding a towel which we had in our bathroom it had dirty marks on it.The cleaner was informed "
"12562","The day excursion to Pretoria we asked about at the concierge desk suddenly moved to a higher price as we started the tour the next day."
"12563","I work as a manager on duty at the intercontinental hotels in the usa this is the worst hotel I ever stayed in my life"
"12564","Amazing hotel. Looks like a little village. To all reviewers complaining about staff-moodiness, don't forget that morocco has a tip-culture. You have to tip the hotel staff, it's a sign that they do their work right. Staff was fine to us. Room was spotless clean. Cleaners cleaned the hotel every hour. Perfectly clean. Pool area was nice. Great value for the small price we payed. We did not expect it to be this good considdering the price and the fact that it's in a third world country. So low price, still so perfect. We feel amazingly lucky with having stayed here. I recommend it to all!"
"12565","Close to shopping and attractions. Helpful staff. We received a warm welcome and found the hotel to be ideally situated for shops, entertainment and restaurants."
"12566","Safe and clean."
"12567","Need to improve the housekeeping scheduling."
"12568","Room and bathroom are spacious and everything functioned The beach, although you have to cross aroad is great."
"12569","Staff seems uninterested Diningroom is depressing. The whole buildingcomplex is not in a shining state."
"12570","Excellent location and great value for money"
"12571","The only remarcable things is the restourant: not so bad...."
"12572","Cleanliness completly absent...no room structures maintenace...  quality-price is 000000000000000000"
"12573","Nice staff, perfect location"
"12574","Strong wifi connection even thought we were out of the hotel. "
"12575","Check-in and check-out could have been a little quicker with less waiting time."
"12576","I guess this is cheapest hotel in Varadero, its close to beach, bar 24 is down in the hotel and there is also store across the street. For this price you got good room and breakfast. They dont know how to prepare good food, but that is all around Cuba (mostly)"
"12577","Rooms are smaller than I expected and little dark, but except that it is good place to stay."
"12578","Absolutely perfect location on the 'golden mile' for eating and drinking out. Pool view rooms much more preferable to mountain/street view rooms. Love being able to hire pool towel and get a nice clean and dry one every day, saves on the packing! Also love being able to choose to sunbathe at either Med Palace or Cleo Palace pool depending on whether you want activities and games or peace and quiet. Free safe in room a nice touch too."
"12579","Rooms need a complete makeover! They are nowhere near 5 (or even 4) star standard. Maybe back when hotel first built 25 years ago, but not up to modern day standards of decor or facilities. All furniture/bed linens/drapes need updating, old style tv's need replacing with flat screens, fridge should come as standard in 5* hotel rather than having to pay extra. Overall, they just need a complete overhaul-looking v tired and dated and need to be brought up to date with what you expect these days when booking a 4/5* hotel."
"12580","The hotel is excellent, facilities and staff are excellent. Foid at breakfast and in the restaurants was simply excellent. The value fir money is excellwnt and I thi k they have the best hotel rooms in Malta.    I would recommend rhis hotel to anyone. "
"12581","the cleanliness was superficial,  I took a shower to discover hairs which were not mine. There is a church directly opposite some rooms, the bells ring every 15 mins. It may be worth requesting to be located away feom these if you are a light sleeper. I complained and was mived the next day.    I have marked the food down as in my final morning I ordered breakfast in my room.  The cooked breakfast was dreadful and the presentation was poor!     The staff on the whole were great, courteous and efficient. Ive marked diwn purely because I dont think the service is quite what I woukd expect from 5*.     "
"12582","There was a fridge in the room but no kettle or facilities to make yourself a cup of tea, the only facilities were drinks machines inthe downstairs lobby. The beds were wrapped in rubber covers making them very sweaty to sleep in and it wasn't even hot. Very poor 'continental' breakfast."
"12583","Very good access for the NEC Exhibition Centre"
"12584","Very helpful as we were leaving before breakfast the following day. We suggested a continental which only included cereal and toast "
"12585","Maybe put on website what time breakfasts start as we missed out    We suggested a continental which only included cereal and toast "
"12586","Excellent Hotel.   Nice large room with well appointed bathroom.   Great breakfast  Spa "
"12587","excellent facilities good entertainment great location will definately go back "
"12588","Great hotel very close to radio arena for an event ,superb "
"12589","Room was extremely clean and prefect for one night. Nice big power shower. Room bit on the small side but honestly who dances around their room anyway?! Would stay here again. Good location."
"12590","Great location  - right on the beach, use of the two restaurant pools, and connected to kartika plaza"
"12591","Very tired room, awful colours, faded, mouldy, dirty. Shower not work properly. No soap.  1 star should suffice this property."
"12592","The hotel is as you would expect, its clean, comfortable, friendly service"
"12593","If i was going to put something negative it would be that the hotel room has very few facilities but for the price i wasnt expecting more"
"12594","This is a great place in which to stay. And especially for a first time visitors for safari's. Good grounds, nice facilities and things to do. Breakfast, dinner and one game drive(morning or evening) per day were included in my rate. Other options available too. Very convenient. The restaurant is great. Buffet. Good food and a good view. The Hide was fantastic. With some patience I saw Elephants, Zebra, Kudu, Wildebeest, a warthog, birds and small lizards all in one afternoon. The game drives were real good too. Two thumbs up on the Kwa Maritane. "
"12595","Facilities in the room. Nice patio for breakfast  "
"12596","Too far from the city centre for a city trip... (About 15 minutes on foot)"
"12597","Best situated hotel in cordoba, next to mezquita en close to restaurants and shops."
"12598","Nothing. Tip: park your car at the other site of the river for free and walk in 10 minutes to this hotel!"
"12599","We had a rainforest chalet, which was situated very well, giving us complete privacy, so that we did not have to draw the blinds - I love looking out on nature! The room was very clean and spacious, and it had all the facilities we needed, including a fridge, so that we could buy some drinks, keep them cold, and sit out on the balcony and enjoy the peace and quiet there before dinner. Perfect!"
"12600","Getting the shuttle bus back and forth from our room was annoying, especially if you happened to forget something, but really only a minor setback - I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to family and friends."
"12601","The hotel whilst outdated was very clean and the staff were very attentive, in particular the waiters. They were excellent."
"12602","This was a bit basic in terms of food choices and the rooms were quite in need of an update. We arrived late and went for a swim and the pool is very poorly lit for evening swims. Also our corridor smelt very badly of a strong chemical smell - took your breath away when you opened the door. For a few nights it does the job but for any longer I think it's worth spending a little more and going somewhere less ""cattle"" like"
"12603","Hotel very central to locations in legian. Staff very friendly and polite and accommodating. Room was very big and bed was huge. Never had such a massive bed. Like two double beds together. Balcony spacious all with pool view. Was very happy with hotel. On day of booking out (12pm) I was extremely ill. Staff were very helpful and let us stay in room for longer until I felt better to travel to next destination. For this I appreciated their concern for me and helpfulness to make it as comfortable for me as they could. Thankyou. "
"12604","Breakfast was adequate but for price we have stayed in other hotels with more selections and variety each day. Was only thing I found as a negative but not a biggy. "
"12605","Friendly receptionists and housekeeping staff.    A sufficient amount of shower gel in the bathrooms; unlike some hotels that insist on providing miniature bars of soap that dissolve during the first shower."
"12606","The lighting is not sufficient. Fluorescent lights are needed in the rooms.    The carpet in the whole building needs to be removed; it is dated. Wooden floors would be more welcoming and hygienic.     The insulation in the room was horrible because of the old wooden windows. I suggest that a glass screen needs to be added to keep the draughts out.    The bathroom needs to be heated since it is a bit of a shock to the system to leave a relatively warm room to go to a chilly bathroom to use the toilet."
"12607","Nice hotel, very helpful and friendly staff, right next to the beach with lovely views, good value for money"
"12608","Excellent hotel, well located in a quite area. But close to everything.  Friendly staff, good breakfast. Large, clean and very confortable room.  Highly recommended hotel.  We had a wonderful time.  Regards to  staff."
"12609","Nothing to point out."
"12610","The good thing about this hotel is mainly it's central location. Quick access to the subway and city center - possible even on foot. People at the check in desk were helpful and nice. The room clean and equipped with a TV and fridge. (this is about Convencion hotel in Madrid)"
"12611","On the flipside it was quite expensive to start with. No WiFi in the room in this day and age is a complete failure. To use the internet you need to go down to the main hall for WiFi or pay 4 euro per hour to use the PCs that are located in the same place. The hotel needs refreshing - especially the corridors on the upper floors as there are stains on the carpets older than the piramids.  (this is about Convencion hotel in Madrid)"
"12612","Nice staff. Very clean. Nice and big balcony. "
"12613","Same food for both lunch and dinner and everything tasted the same. Old rooms with some parts falling apart. Lunch started at 1, we thought that was to late. "
"12614","Good rooms and very good location for business and shopping."
"12615","Only spent one night there and the electricity got cut off twice in the evening and took them quite a long time to fix."
"12616","I would give a -5 for the above and advice guests NOT to choose that hotel."
"12617","Good location, good staff, quote good value for money    But rooms nice and clean"
"12618","Great location at the lakeside. "
"12619","Rooms very old and the look is 70's"
"12620","More than friendly staff, clean rooms and pretty central, great value."
"12621","if you dont mind shared bathrooms this is perfect."
"12622","close to the center of Corralejo, 5 minutes away from the bus station to move around the island and from the touristic harbour to go to Lanzarote, it's the right place to stay both for surfing or not. A very nice place with big confortables rooms, there's also a swimming pool, but you'll always be on the beach! :)"
"12623","Very easy to book and use very nice hotel lovely rooms"
"12624","Simple, clean and everything worked. Great location for shops etc. breakfast is simple and possibly the most efficient system I've seen. It's self service with everything clearly labeled above sections so you don't have to go back and forward. Lovely eating area. I felt quite happy even though I was on my own. Staff really nice and friendly. I used bag storage and this worked perfectly. I've already booked for my next trip."
"12625","Outside area around hotel is not as nice as others. If you get past this bit it's perfect."
"12626","Very comfortable hotel and  room, nice swimming pool. The food in the restaurant was super. . "
"12627","In the centre of Old Havana - which now has had a lot of buildings done up.    Note that the Valencia is connected to another hotel.  Checkin, breakfast, and reception were done in the Valencia while my room was actually in the connected hotel.  The other reception was unmanned.  We were told by our guide that all these old buildings are being done up and managed by one of the Government Agencies with the money we spend being used to continue the restoration of Old Havana."
"12628","Very nice and friendly staff that made us feel very welcome, especially the manager. And we would love to come back to one of her studios, or this in particular."
"12629","Very good location. Perfect balkony"
"12630","The rooms in the tower building are great, spacious, with a balcony and geat views.  The Manager took ownership of the issues we had with our check-in process and the quality of the rooms we were initially allocated to.  The qualityof the food in the restaurant is outstanding, enjoyed the live entertainment at the bar too."
"12631","We had sent emails with requests and questions to both Hotelopia and Moana Surfrider, months  before we left. Neither responded which was disappointing.  The check-in process at Moana Surfrider was a poor experience, trooms not ready, no accountability for not responding to emails, even blamed booking through third parties. The manager took ownership and we were very happy after our rooms were changed to the Tower Building.    In the traditional building, the rooms are very small, with no balconies, not a great experience for Hawaii.  I don't recommend staying in this building,    I would stay there again, in the Tower Building and book direct, they took no accountability booking through a third party."
"12632","Great location. Easy to find, great value for money. "
"12633","Was not properly instructed about parking, took a while to figure it out. Lights in the room weren't easy to operate at 2 in the morning, should have been told at reception that they were not the standard room key card type. "
"12634","Good airport hotel, no problems would stay again."
"12635","Things were clean and fresh even with the age of this grand hotel!  The persons working there went out of their  to make us feel welcome and were helpful in every .  Great stay."
"12636","Nothing negative"
"12637","Location location location  Waitress, luggage staff and male manager were super friendly.  Food delicious."
"12638","Way over priced, the location is awesome but a thousand other properties there also have that view. The rooms need a serious refurbishment.  Never have we met a more unfriendly female hotel manager. Did not make us feel welcome at all."
"12639","nice location, nice building, easy parking, friendly staff (we're in Cuba!)"
"12640","Brilliant location, service and rooms all at a reasonable price. "
"12641","Fantastic food at the restaurant (a la carte) and friendly, proffessional staff at the hotel. Great location, in the middle of the city centre, within walking distance of the night markets etc. "
"12642","Not a high end 4/5 star hotel- the rooms appear to be a bit dated. We had gone for an upgrade to the executive club and had access to the executive lounge- the pre-dinner drinks and canopes were disappointing (compared to those that we have experienced in the Far East). Not value for money considering the cost of staying at the hotel. "
"12643","New, slick, with great management. Wonderful welcome, fab room "
"12644","Niggly negatives like - why hide the ground floor bar away? Lifts take too long to come. The room cards (which you need for the lift) needed to be revalidated frequently (very annoying). "
"12645","This hotel is in a central position in Ubud and has all restaurants and shops outside this resort. The rooms are clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast is basic but nice. The pool has a nice outlook over the rice fields .         The WI FI worked in our room. Overall  the resort is a good relaxing place to stay whilst in Ubud. Would stay there again."
"12646","The staff went out of their  to be super hospitable . I travelled alone (lady) whilst visiting friends, and felt safe and welcome. Wonderful, can't wait to go back!"
"12647","located at the old town  big swimming pool"
"12648","dated room furnitures and equipment"
"12649","Ideal for Business Trips as the hotel is very close to the airport. Hotel offers Shuttle-Service. Very service orientated and friendly staff in all areas as reception, bar, restaurant. We were very surprised about the excelent food in the restaurant. "
"12650","We have stayed at this hotel quite a few times,and always find it good.also very accessible from the station."
"12651","Rooms are looking quite tired now could do with a make over."
"12652","Clean and tidy."
"12653","Swimming pool closed.  Small bar, always empty and closed very early.  Very old building.  Staff was unable to provide guidance apart from the very basics."
"12654","Good value for money if you are looking for a reasonably-priced bed for the night in an expensive area. The breakfasts were excellent. "
"12655","The hotel rooms are somewhat 'tired' and could do with refurbishing.  The carpets weren't vacuumed during our 3-night stay but the beds were clean and fresh towels were put out every day.  For the price we paid and the amount of time actually spent in the hotel, overall we felt it was good value."
"12656","I have stayed here a few times, and it's been just OK. Rooms not that clean, and staff a bit rude, but great location!  But the last time, I had a CONFIRMED reservation with acknowledgement from the hotel, and when I came at 3:00pm, they told me they had no room and they were overbooked.  They wanted to put me  down at the end of the soi at their dirty sister property, the Royal Asia.    How can you rely on a hotel that doesn't honor a confirmed reservation, at 3:00pm nonetheless!!  I spoke to the manager over the phone and he basically said too bad! Really unprofessional."
"12657","All staff is very gentle, the hotel is very good located. There aren´t a lot of people so it is comfortable.   The beds are ok (not good, not bad), the air condition functions well.  The wood behind the hotel is beautiful."
"12658","The bath is small, it doesn't have pool, but you can use the pool of 2 hotels that are located 1 block (club almendares) and 5 blocks (Hotel Kolhy) away."
"12659","The hotel is within a 5 minute (if that) walk of the station. It's off the main road so everythig is close by but it's quiet. The staff (on the day shift anyway) were very helpful and polite. They made us aware of all the facilities available and made check in and check out fast and hassle free. The room was small but very cosy. Perfect size for a couple or friends staying for a short break. There's hangers with the wardrobe, a kettle, a tv that actually works how it's supposed to, shower gel. even a dock station so everything you need. I always stay there and I'm always happy with my choice."
"12660","although reading some reviews on this hotel and being surprised that some people were disappointed with the customer service, I have never really had any problems however on my last visit it was finally brought to light why people felt this . The staff that served me during check in and check out were extremely polite however after a night out to a restaurant. me and my friend returned to the hotel and as we walked through the lobby the people at reception stopped us and questioned our presence by asking us hat we're doing at the hotel and if we have a room. They even had the cheek to ask us which room we are staying in and after that they just went hm alright. not even an apology or a polite approach. It was as though they were trying to imply that just because we're young we couldn't afford it... I found it extremely rude and offensive. But it was only 2 members of the staff. The rest were extremely polite. Doubt couples would have any problems just youngsters, be prepared to get interrogated aha. "
"12661","A lovely room and very enjoyable dinner."
"12662","central location, accomodating, access to wifi and a computer, good breakfast buffet, great decor"
"12663","Good location, 5 mins walking from Bayswater metro station at nice, ellegant and quiet street. Comfortable bed, generally quite place outside the windows, luggage room available."
"12664","Lack of adapters in reception that almost caused 3 days without mobile phone. When we asked receptionist for some help, she sent us to some shops in the city. In 4* hotel, I would expect something more, as well as free water. Rooms are nive and fancy, but they might have more space at this price."
"12665","Good value, nice room, friendly staff (except for one at reception), decent breakfast."
"12666","A little noisy. Situated directly at a busy intersection does not help with the noise level."
"12667","1= No customer care. I requested three week before arrival to arrange pick up from air port. no body even replied my mail.   2= I have forgot  my SAMSUNG MEGA cell original charger in room. I would appreciate, if I get it back. "
"12668","The decoration of the room was very attractive. Very good design that creates warm feelings. Also the room was big enough and very clean."
"12669","It was beautiful and probably one of the best hotel I've been to."
"12670","Lovely hotel, well situated, nice staff, great breakfast, enjoyed our stay"
"12671","The staff at this hotel were extremely helpful and customer focused. We can not fault the hotel on their customer service"
"12672","The hotel needs a definite refurb. Very dated. Damp on floors and furniture,swimming pool was so cold we couldnt get in it. The sauna had wood from the 1800's. No obvious reception from the outside, wandered around not knowing where to go. I felt it was a great shame to have such fantastic staff in a fantastic area with a hotel that was crying out for some tlc. Lovely area,lovely people but the hotel standards let it down"
"12673","Great hotel; well located and generally clean and well presented.  Front desk staff excellent and always greeting nicely.  Very helpful and accommodating.  Room was clean and as expected; free use of safe and wi-fi.  No real complaints just the odd tweak as below would push to 5 for all."
"12674","Breakfast is limited to continental style;   Toaster is a bummer! We have to wait.  Would be nice if kitchen staff were ALL in uniform rather than casual tee shirt as this is otherwise a 4 star hotel.    Guests have to pay for use of leisure facilities.  It's my opinion that should be free for guests staying there.    This was our second visit there and again booked in March for a further stay."
"12675","not all in"
"12676","Excellent food,-a 50 years celebration - ,suited for children, very beautiful pink sky when we woke up and a nice view from our window."
"12677","We had booked a family room, supposedly sleeping 4. There was one double and one single bed. There were no other rooms available, and no trundle beds. We had to squeeze the kids into a single bed. We received an apology and were told we would get a refund. I gave full contact details, never heard back.  Air conditioner outside window went on and off all night long, with an audible thump every time it started.  "
"12678","Very good Location. Clean, very quit. Breackfast until 12:00. "
"12679","Very small bed room"
"12680","Nice hotel, clean well decorated room and friendly personnel."
"12681","The clock on the wall didn't function. Merely a matter of a new battery I guess. "
"12682","Very friendly and helpful staff  Clean and tidy room  Good connection to the underground  Close to bars and restaurants"
"12683","On arrival I was surprised to be given a double upgrade to a spacious 1200 square foot oceanfront suite with a separate bedroom and two full bathrooms.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  A wonderful stay.  "
"12684","Parking not within the grounds"
"12685","Awkward entrance when arriving by car right on a very busy junction and no onsite parking available. "
"12686","great location,helpful staff"
"12687","Great all round experience. Good hotel for business travellers with own transport."
"12688","Not located in touristy area so more suited for business traveller."
"12689","The resort is superb...I enjoyed my stay there and would recommend it to my friends as well...keep up the good work guys...Cheers"
"12690","We stayed here because it was 2 mins from ikea... Great location"
"12691","The room was a bit shabby, chipped doors etc the heating wasn't on and there was no extra blankets provided "
"12692","It´s very well located, very close to edgare road where theere are many buses throughout London.    Bed was quite confortable and good shower."
"12693","There were problems with heating in our room. We were given an electric radiator, and staff the first day denied there was any problem at all.    The english breakfast is very peculiar: just bolied eggs, cheese and toasts. Forget any other usual components of an english breakfast!"
"12694","Nice to have the free of charge guided walking tour of the Alfama neighbourhood"
"12695"," - location;   - the garden and the pools;   - the view;   - activities."
"12696"," - same breakfast everyday;   - unfriendly reception staff."
"12697","A great hotel for a shirt trip to Nice. The staff was fun, gentle and nice but not very useful. The room was nice, very cool old style (vintage design), beautiful pictures on the walls. The whole hotel is a nicely equipped villa with a lot of french charme. The only minus point was the temperature in our room. Since weather turned worse it got about 10° C outside and below 18° C inside. badly isolating door and windows. "
"12698","From the moment we walked in everything was great staff rooms foods."
"12699","Lifts are a little confusing."
"12700","Awesome Hotel, would totallly recommend it!"
"12701","The staff was very welcoming and helpful. The hotel had a very good and clean surface and the rooms were cleaned daily. Gym facilty was amazingly good to be at a Tunisian hotel. I was very happy with that. Short distance to the Marina was a good thing too. "
"12702","Food is so and so... Not a lot to chose from, but taste was okay. They did although have a few problems knowing what kind of meat etc they had. Saying that some meat was turkey when it actually was red meat is bad! Also the fact that room keys (cards) had to be recharged more than once during a week stay is not cool. Some rooms had more problems with the key than others. "
"12703","The hotel is situated close to Kensington park, Paddington station, close to bus stop of bus 23, which goes to Liverpool station"
"12704","The hotel does NOT have a storage room, so if neccessary to leave the luggage for some time, it can be left ONLY in the hall, unattended, the hotel staff will not be responsible for it."
"12705","We'll positioned in queen street.Valet and concierge service high standard however the room was very bad with Air conditioning unit not working and positioned straight opposite a pub .Despite telling staff I was not happy about it  they really did not care and telling me that they could not do anything about it as they were booked up (a bit p.. Off when you have booked for 4 nights)"
"12706","Poor room opposite a pub withA/C not working for 48 hours . Asked if could  be change to another room no sympathy from front reception saying they were all booked up .Knowing that I have booked 4 nights at a premium price  ( exclusive suite) I felt very disappointed and would not call that good service more an we do not care attitude.Regarding the A /C unit after complaining to reception and felling like I was a moron because I could not use the A/C properly as per instruction they send me a technician and guess what they needed to change a part of the unit .After changing the part all was ok for A/C however no sorry or apologized from reception for being Ina 38 degree room most of 2 days !!! not Happy"
"12707","friendly staff, lovely large  quiet room, really comfortable large bed.good quality towels "
"12708","Cleanest and most inviting jury's inn I ever stayed in, rooms were spotless cosy and warm. Staff were friendly and very helpfull especially the bar man we met from cork. Great location in the city Newcastle just 5mins from central station."
"12709","Stayed two nights in November and only sampled the breakfast which was great. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were clean. Fresh towels daily and a great location from which to travel in to central London. "
"12710","We were in the downstairs bar having a quiet drink when a wedding party descended on the bar.  The staff rescued us from the scrum and really looked after us when they didn't have to which helped the wedding party and us."
"12711","good hotel and location for nightlife and shopping"
"12712","Lovely Hotel...Got engaged and they give us a bottle of buddly on the house. Expensive but worth the money. "
"12713","Well trained professional reception staff, Location and size of room, "
"12714","food and facilities, lack of training of restaurant staff"
"12715","Didn't seem to be a phone in the room. Very small point and had no need to contact front desk, but would have had to leave room if I did."
"12716","Amazing view on down town Mahmutlar and the Med.Sea.  Staff very very friendly.  Quiet rooms/environment."
"12717","Quite a distance away from the main road and shopping centre."
"12718","Very friendly staff, a nice room set in a beautiful garden and an astonishing view on the two-color river from the two restaurants"
"12719","Bathroom was very small and not as clean as I would have liked but it was usable "
"12720","Parking is a little difficult (take your car away) and expensive."
"12721","Excellent location and beautifully presented. "
"12722","Floor Dirty. Bathroom shower broken, Air Con Could not control. TV Not working properly. Food Terrible will never stay there again"
"12723","Excellent service by staff. Smiles, professionalism and efficiency. Two thumbs up!"
"12724","Rooms and facilities in rooms are dated. Limited TV channels. Time for a renovation and upgrading job?"
"12725","Located in strategic location ... Near to beach and easy to get food.."
"12726","The Comforter is stained and the floor mat in the toilet is dirty...there is no sound proof.. There's a couple  Arguing in front of my room for 30 minutes and we can hear what they argued clearly"
"12727","This hotel was fantastic. The staff are very friendly, hotel location is perfect....everything is right on your doorstep. We ordered room service twice and the food was gorgeous and reasonably priced for Moscow although the portions could have been a bit bigger. The room was superb, very comfortable bed, very big room and nice and quiet.  Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again if we went to Moscow."
"12728","Nothing negative to say about this hotel."
"12729","Spotlessly clean.   Friendly staff.  Ideal position for beach, shops and restaurants."
"12730","Rooms were cold at night"
"12731","Location is convenient.  Food is better than expected.  Suffice it to say, totally money worth.  "
"12732","Clean room, friendly staff, good location"
"12733","The internal soundproofing is not particularly good. I was in a room next to some young girls and perhaps they were a little noisy but in fairness, you could hear them talking at a normal volume as well as hear all their music and doors opening/closing. Wooden furniture being dragged across tiled flooring could be heard very often and often woke me up / kept me awake - god I sound like a moany old man! This was my only complaint!"
"12734","Breakfast could be improved, but I'd say it is high average quality for Cuba."
"12735","Great hotel. The staff were very professional and friendly and most spoke English. We chose the location based on ease of transport to Yongpyong and access to Lotte World.  The bus to Yongpyong left from outside the hotel. Every question we had about Seoul were answered by the concierge staff, brilliant. The hotel presents as 5 star, the room was very comfortable and a good size. I would recommend this hotel."
"12736","None about the actual hotel, Lotte World is over rated. If you have been to Disney World, then Lotte World looks like it is lost in the 70's."
"12737","This Hotel is in an excellent location on Legian Beach.  Easy for shopping massage and many good restaurants!  I would stay here again:)"
"12738","Really nice room, very comfortable bed. Staff really friendly. "
"12739","Accessible, clean, has good food, staff were professional, and rooms were capacious."
"12740","All was perfect: the staff, the breakfast, the rooms, but most of all, I was feeling like at home. If I will return to Krakow, this will be my first choice."
"12741","Good location, very friendly staff, clean and tidy."
"12742","Very noisy due to heavy traffic to the main beach. No free Wi-fi."
"12743","Lovely location with a great breakfast."
"12744","Additional charges for parking."
"12745","excellent location. pricey, but all Kilkenny appears to be concerning accommodation. staff fab"
"12746","I have stayed there more than 8 times this year and still have not received a loyalty card after applying 3 times???"
"12747","The Deauville is really well located on the Malceon, close enough to the sights but far enough away that you can get away to relax. Roof top pool and bar = great after a long sweaty day in Havana! This hotel was really well priced and one of seemingly few mid price options. Havana has lots of expensive fancy hotels and some questionable looking hostels, so this was a great in the middle option. Would definitely stay here again.   "
"12748","Not fancy, but that wasn't what we were expecting for this price! "
"12749","they charged me MAD 40 as taxes even though when booked all charges were included.  They would not listen to me and insisted i pay the tax.  you may take this issue with the hotel so others are not affected"
"12750","Bad booking and follow up arrangement by Somerset Olympia Makati.  I booked and prepaid the stay at Somerset Olympia Makati for 2 nights, however, when I checked in, they told me only 1 night stay was confirmed; the hotel was fully booked and not able to offer my second night stay.  And they would made arrangement and transferred me to another hotel.  Somerset Olympia Makati had no confirmation for the transfer arrangement until the very last moment around 2pm of the second day afternoon; and without any choice.  They then transferred me to Berjaya Makati Hotel which is located in a not convenient location, and the hotel quality is not good.  But I had no other choice at such last moment arrangement by Somerset Olympia; very bad arrangement by them."
"12751","The resort has a lot going for it.  Great location.  Great Staff.  Great Food."
"12752","It is as if the management has deferred spending on the resort until the Marriott group moves in.  Not enough beach umbrellas or shade provided for the lounges.  Old wooden based lounges and mattresses need replacing.  Beach side staff not proactive in taking orders for food or drinks, etc  Beach towels need refreshing.  The two restaurants basically have the same menus for lunch and dinner, if possible it would be good if there were greater variety between the two restaurants.    The resort is doing itself a disservice by missing out on a range of small things that take the gloss off a truly 5 star resort.    We thoroughly enjoyed our week at the resort as none of the items listed above really took away from the positives the resort offers. My comments are more aimed at little things that hinder it being a 5 star resort."
"12753","Excellent location. Very handy for the NEC, rail and airport.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Charged for parking but £7 for over 24 hours was great value."
"12754","they Take me two times money from my credit card and do not like give me back this money. They propably never give. I pay for hotel by Hotelopia but not accept this and I pay two times by hotelopia and this another compny   So please find some solution for this and try to force them that thay give me the money back. Also no english this polish people. Also they do not know haw to service for 5 star hotel. They mast go to Asia to lern little for service to coustomers"
"12755","Good service from entering the door on our arrival until we left. Staff very helpful and friendly will stay again"
"12756","Good central hotel with helpful staff. I would stay again"

"12761","Good value for money. Friendly staff. Very accommodating."
"12762","Rooms are Very Compact. One can still stay there. If you are very particular about the room size then this is not for you."
"12763","Very friendly and professional staff. The bed, pillows, shower, aircndition and mini bar is good. Close to the BKK airport. 7 eleven and bar right next to the hotel."
"12764","Poor soundproofing. Slamming doors woke me up several times during the night"
"12765","Be sure to read about hotel parking policy very expensive"
"12766","This hotel is really fantastic, both in terms of location and of luxury. The room has some really cool little touches that we didn't expect given the reasonable price of the hotel. It is located right in the city centre, not far from Raffles and the marina. The hotel lobby is something to see, particularly when you look up and see the atrium stretch up beyond where the eye could see. We only stayed here one night on our arrival prior to leaving on a cruise and would happily have stayed longer. We have also stayed in the Marina Bay Sands and the rooms at the Pan Pacific impressed us much more! Will definitely be back."
"12767","Really good hotel, a long-ish walk to the centre but an interesting one. A very enjoyable stay in a hotel with a charming character and very friendly and helpful staff."
"12768","room,parking service, staff all good,bed was really comfy"
"12769","Close to Queensbay mall, which was the main reason I chose this facility."
"12770","Apartments look dated and needs an urgent makeover."
"12771","Lovely hotel the standard of our room was exceptional, modern, clean "
"12772","The hotel is in a fantastic site right in the centre of Madrid ,2 mins away from airport bus stop - 5. Euros from the airport and really regular service a real positive"
"12773","I read reviews and they mentioned small lifts but that was my only negative  and the position right in the centre far out ways this one fault "
"12774","Just a Great Place to stat in Vilnius. Free WiFi and TV Channels from many countries with different languages. "
"12775","Its pretty nice hotel and clean equipped with a shopping complex around the corner but the problem is very limited parking space and small. My opinion is that, since it opened until now, this hotel is already well known in and outside the country, especially Brunei, why we did not think to add or make more parking space with more sophisticated facilities for visitors who want to stay overnight?"
"12776","About the negative reviews, I have a little problem with 'Air conditioning' in the room. It is not cold at all and I feel unhappy about it... But I did not know whether it was just 'air conditiong' in the room only or all rooms in the hotel.    I hope the hotel management would be able to monitor the air conditioner in the room. For the record, I stayed in room 1510 on 16 November 2013 and I can not slept well that night because I felt uncomfortable at all that night."
"12777"," Operator's responce was kind and on time.  Doorman activates  quikly."
"12778","Friendly and helpul staff  Very close to Sawgrass Mills  Free parking  Free wifi  Fridge and mucrowave in room  Nice beds  Indivudual setting A.C.  Free baby cot.  Very good iron and ironing board."
"12779","Full cover carpet in room and all hallways, why? Room therfore unhygenic and smells of damp cloth.  Fixed shower tap (no hose and handle), how to get a proper wash off of soap?  Noicy fridge.  Limited space for bagage, only one foldable suitcase rack.  "
"12780","Very modern and nice hotel. Professional and service-minded staff. A super conference hotel. A nice pool and a lot of space for relaxation."
"12781","A bit too long trip to center of London. You have to understand the system of trains and underground very well. "
"12782","Very good position."
"12783","The beds are uncomfortable. Poor kitchen."
"12784","If you are happy to walk around half an hour to the centro this is a good location as right near port area and bars/resturants. The staff were accommodating. The twin seaview rooms were spacious and great views."
"12785","The rooms were neat and tidy."
"12786","I specifically booked this hotel because of the outdoor pool on a beautiful sunny adelaide weekend.  I was bitterly disappointed to find a note on the door of the pool saying it was closed.  I spoke to the staff about it and said how upset i was.  It was due to an unbalance in the pool, the staff seemed to be trying to balance it but it wasnt happening.  What i dont understand is why wasnt there a note on  the booking form for this hotel to say the pool was out of order?? and why wasnt a professional called to fix the pool. I will never stay here again!!!"
"12787","this is my fourth visit to Honolulu in the last five years, and have stayed at two other hotels , and this was the best for living space. I felt safe and secure , as I was by choice travelling solo "
"12788","I thought the $15 a day resort fee, should only apply if you wished to avail yourself with the services offered, as I could not work out how to use the DVD entertainment system , I feel I wasted $210."
"12789","Staff welcoming and helpful."
"12790","A bug bare for me was no plug sockets near bed to charge phone or laptop and use them whilst on bed.  Bathroom floor looks great in slate but very very slippery when wet, pretty but not practical.  If I had children I would have been concerned.  Basin plug was permanently closed even when pressing plunger to release it, I fixed it myself by adjusting screw at end.  Bath plug the same but no release plunger present at all, I had to use credit card edge to release plug from hole.  Light in hallway not working was completely dark at night time used my key ring torch.  Room 21 was ground floor almost opposite main entrance, no smoking inside building so all smokers used pathway outside entrance opposite my room, as a non smoker it was the worst part of my stay it stunk the room out.  For a 4* hotel I've stayed in better 2* to be honest."
"12791","great value for money, given the location and ease of getting to and from Sheremetyevo airport"
"12792","It is a great place for someone who is looking for tranquility and rest.  The owners and staff make one feel very welcomed but at the same time, respect one's privacy.  I will return, definately."
"12793","I've stayed at the Metropolitan for 6 nights. The room was clean and it had everything I've needed (mineral water and coffee are provided). I've had a problem with the internet and when it was not solved I was given another upgraded room. The staff was very helpful and nice, especially Jinam at the front desk, who really helped. When I'm next time in Toronto I'll probably try to book this hotel first (if the price is right).    "
"12794","thank you wery much for esenhotel the is hotel wey nice  staf wet frendly nice  room good price  good location   the is hotel 24/h free driking hot and cold driking  the is hotel better my  house  realy room sea view boshphorus  very clean room same catagori  room anodher hotel  it is very expensive"
"12795","The staff at this hotel are really great, probably one of the best things about the hotel.  They are good humored and very helpful.  The food is expensive but very very good.  "
"12796","The breakfast was not good and very over priced at £17.95.  The free shuttle bus to the airport was also a bit of a disaster.  We waited over half an hour.  The manager was not very helpful pointing out it was a free service but it was advertised as being available and one of the reasons we had booked this hotel."
"12797","Location is excellent if you're going to spend time near the beach road"
"12798","After reading some of the negative reviews about this hotel I was a little concerned. We found the hotel room was large,comfortable and clean. The staff were friendly and I would not hesitate to book again."
"12799","Very helpful reception staff, and driver "
"12800","Poor breakfast,  out of fashion hotel need some renovation, "
"12801","This hotel is amazing! We loved everything about it, the staff, the location, the rooms and the facilities."
"12802","This is an amazing place. If you are looking for a piece of paradise away from crowds this is the place. Staff are so gentle and genuinely nice.  I spent 4 days there with a friend and on my last day staff made me a cake as they found out it was my birthday.  If you are looking for some great food near by be sure to eat at Warung Apple best place to eat in Lovina and prices are unreal (Really Cheap)"
"12803","Great airport hotel. Kind and enthousiast personnel."
"12804","Great value for money and the location is excellent for walking into town. "
"12805","They make you give your card details on arrival even though you have paid for the room. I asked why and wasn't given a satisfactory answer. It turns out there is a mini bar in the room. No mention of the requirement of card details on booking so I was annoyed with this. "
"12806","Very friendly staff and beautiful poolarea."
"12807","Not free wireless wifee in rooms, lobby and poolarea, a big minus. Little variety in breakfastbuffet. "
"12808","power water,location"
"12809","the room is small and a little crowded"
"12810","Counter staffs are very helpful and professional. Hotel location is convenient too. Maybe hotel management should consider to start their renovation plan. :)"
"12811","Very clean hotel, fantastic food, all staff very friendly and helpful"
"12812","the atmosphere was pleasant. The hotel does have character, you could say grandeur crumbling at the edges. The double room was very spacious, furniture was all antique and the bathroom was a fair size. The women at reception were all very friendly and went out of their  to be helpful which could not be said about the male receptionists. Breakfast bar was excellent."
"12813","The staff in the breakfast room were not up to speed at all. Every morning I ordered cappuchino which I only received half  through my breakfast. Also the background music in the breakfast room was the same CD all week - trance music?!"
"12814","Very welcoming staff. Everyone from the receptionists to the assistant food and beverage manager was helpful and polite. It is an older hotel but very well maintained and the views from the deluxe rooms were superb. Excellent swimming pool. It is one of the few hotels we have encountered lately where the room is made up early morning. We return regularly and always enjoy our stay"
"12815"," Nothing negative to stay. We would highly recommend this hotel"
"12816","All staff were very helpful and my stay in this hotel suits my needs perfectly for business visits - I am very happy to book through Hotelopia again on the basis of the most competitive value offered for loyalty of custom."
"12817","High level of service, warmth and professionalism.  If I ever visiting Jakarta again this would be the place to stay."
"12818","Well equiped room. Location is central. Close to shopping  and close to U Bahn."
"12819","Night shift staff are nice and helpful   With lift elevator "
"12820","Day shift staff are impolite and not willing to give help  Worms on the wall  Construction site near hotel and noisy until 12mid night"
"12821","Lovely,friendly helpful staff make this hotel a ""must"" for those who value a homely feel over a more polished standard of presentation. The big,comfortable rooms are in need of a face lift but then...so am I!"
"12822","You can't fault the Tabaiba centre. We had a top floor studio apartment at the back and it was fantastic. The room layout was functional and the balcony had sunshine all day. We didn't use the free shuttle service as it was a nice walk to the shops and beach. The staff were friendly and the resort was quiet and relaxing. "
"12823","Staff very good. Position excellent,rooms and linen ckean"
"12824","Very nice hotel 4 stars are well earned!"
"12825","Excellent location. Nice big rooms with big windows and views. Very comfortable beds and pillows. I stay there whenever I am in KL. And still will as I am comfortable there."
"12826","Bit disappointed in the staff this time. No-one to help with bags. Arrived early because of last minute flight change......unlike many other hotels I have stayed in, they were unsympathetic although I had flown all night with no sleep they made me wait till 2pm although there were many people checking out and I offered to pay extra.When I expressed my disappointment they were nicer and more helpful.....but still had to wait!"

"12830","The aircondition unit could not be closed and there was always a draft blowing through."
"12831","we stayed for a week the hotel is a unique piece of history and very pleasant, the room facilities TV, fridge,cooking equipment ect are a little dated, rooms are always clean staff are friendly hard working and polite, we had a harbour view which was great entertainment, we recommend the seafood bake night on Fridays it is mouthwatering and takes place on the quayside in front of the hotel, we didn't use the hotel restaurant or bar as we were out and about, but we can recommend the mad mongoose Falmouth harbour (5 mins walk) for food and drink, also if you are looking for a nice beach (15 mins walk) pigeon beach,and if you are adventurous take the number 17 bus from the gate into St john's for the day, all in all a great stay, Brenda and Claudy on reception will help in any  they can ""lovely people"""

"12849","Simple and quick check-in, good sized room, fantastically comfortable bed, very quiet and relaxing night, good breakfast"
"12850","bathroom slightly dated, shower a bit disappointing"

"12852","Beautiful apartment, very nice helpful staff especially the security staff "
"12853","The car park is so huge a map showing my parking bay would of bee a nice touch. When entering the building from the marina side they e are not named and look the same so had difficulty finding mine. The exit out to the front of the building was on level 3 but this wasn't marked on the lift and I wasn't made aware of this, the security guard had to show me."
"12854","The staff were all friendly and very helpful. There is no safe in the room but the safety boxes at reception were free to use. Everything in the room was in working order and the additional space of the suite makes the stay very comfortable."
"12855","Excellent value for the price.  Staff are smiling and attentive.  The bed quality is very good.  Food served 24 hours which is great because I arrived after midnight very hungry.  I enjoyed the gym, pool and jacuzzi.  I highly recommend.  Internet surcharge though is high. "

"12858","Room tempature a little cold wen with additional heaters, difficult to find cutlery (it's in a secret drawer under the dishwasher)"
"12859","Stayed in a junior suite which was very spacious and comfortable. The food is very nice and fresh with plenty of choice."
"12860","Whilst it didn't really bother me, the staff aren't overly forthcoming, particularly in the restaurant. It could for example take time for a new table to be set or someone to take a drink order.  Also the pool is extremely cold and I hardly saw anybody using it, probably for this reason.    "
"12861","Excellent Very attentive and helpful "
"12862","Food could be a little better"
"12863","Clean rooms, good staff and a good breakfast.  The rooms are good and the location is perfect. "

"12865","Very close to beach, to shops, bars, very good swimming pool. Fantastic place - may be little bit used (compare to 4* hotels in EU) but for this money very good! 3 years old child was sleeping very good - actually I was afraid of noise, the others warned - it was very quite, may be as we had pool view rooms we did not hear the noise. We all were satisfied with living in playazul and we will return there next year for sure. The money we spent for rest of family of 5 persons for 11 nights was the same as for 2 persons in 4* hotel for 6 nights. "
"12866","Lovely hotel on the seafront with lots of shops and bars nearby. Beautiful top floor rooms with plunge pool very nice."
"12867","Got to the hotel and was advised it had been over booked and we had no rooms even though we had paid and had booking confirmation and they transferred us to another hotel - 15 minutes away from where we needed to be with the rest of our party!!!!"

"12869","The service was very bad, everytime when i ask about something they say 'NO' to me without explanation, also the food was not good, really i stay before in 2* and 3* star hotels but the service was good and the food more better then in Zodiac. I don't want to come here again"

"12874","Arrived to the hotel at midnight and got a room that smelled mold and had windows open only   8 degrees in the room tried to change the room directly, but it could not be fixed for the next day"
"12875","I like it very much and have lived by You many times.  I should live by You, KOKA, in 3 march, 21 one nights. Booking ref: 6453768. I really would like to live in the mainbuilding because it´s very dangerous outside the small KOKA-buildings in the nights."
"12876","Its ok for one or two days no more .... Location is allright other  wise nothing spécial...."
"12877","No facilités att all no wifi and no service att all .... Even breakfast i had to put many on it even though i hade it included ..... "
"12878","The room was exceptionally clean and spacious enough. The food at breakfast was great as well. "
"12879","The connection between reception and cleaning staff wasn't always excellent."
"12880","Great Hotel, staff very attentive. We got a free upgrade to a junior Suite with a jacuzzi bath which was a real bonus."
"12881","Would have like tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Some of the evening entertainment was a bit naff.   The Spa was not included for guests and was expensive. "
"12882","The staff was very friendly and very helpful the stay at the hotel was wonderful I really enjoyed it the breakfast could have been a little better but over all it was worth the money. Would stay at  tropikist anytime again "
"12883","Excellent friendly hotel. Extremely clean with good service  and good food. "
"12884","Lift out of order.  and no telephone in room . felt quite worried if I should have needed help during the night..   Traveling from the M42 I found getting to the hotel a but tricky."
"12885","Was a great stay, food was divine and the service was excellent."
"12886","Its close to everything, palace, plazza mayor in 10 minutes on foot  and pouerta de sol is 2 minutes on foot. The hotel is in Gran Via and next to it is big dipartment stores like cortes igles, fnac, food chains, restaurants etc The room was very clean ant the staff very helpfull highly recommended!!!!!"
"12887","Hotel is ok but a bit far from airport . Breakfast very expensive  at 17 pounds , and had an evening meal which was very bland at best ."
"12888","Easy to find. Short walk to subway station."
"12889","Not much to do around the hotel at night."
"12890","Made feel uncomfortable on arrival by staff members. They were aware of the reservation however wanted cash payment for room then when explained to them that stay had been paid for they requested credit card details 'just in case !'    I had to produce proof of my payment albeit I told them the onus should have been on them to confirm with yourselves ! "
"12891","staff were very friendly"
"12892","1. off-white carpet in room stained with black marks. dust in places  2. Stingy breakfast-no buffet meal and no real choice. only one choice of alacarte when other hotels offer generous choices in their buffet set up.  3. Very expensive, yet not money's worth  4. Very bad discriminatory pricing- between foreigners who pay in forex and locals who pay in RM"
"12893","The communal areas are very attractive and the honesty bar is a great facility."
"12894","The rooms we had were a bit tired and the bathrooms from a previous era."
"12895","Good place to stay "
"12896","room was great - clean - spacious -- bedding was very comfortable "
"12897","hotel under construction - need to work on their signage for finding the building where your room is located "
"12898","Really nice friendly hotel, brilliant location for   Shopping and loads of pubs and bars nearby, lovely   River views"
"12899","Poor soundproof,i was hearing every sound from   The corridor outside the room."
"12900","Lovely hotel, busy and good atmosphere. "
"12901","Pool area needs a face lift. The ceiling is discoloured and the Jacuzzi was not as clean as I would have expected for a four star hotel. "
"12902","Personally greeted by the owner/manager of the accommodation.  A welcome pack was waiting for us which was really appreciated. Beautiful rooms very spacious with all modern facilities which enables you to self cater should you wish. Extremely clean and maid service excellent. Accommodation situated in a great location at Paynes Bay and close to Holetown.  Fabulous sea views. Pool area spacious, plenty of sun beds.  Gardens manicured.  No bar as such but 'The Hut'  serves breakfast snacks and lunch.  Manager's cocktail party a must if staying on a Thursday evening.  Cocktails on the roof terrace some days. All in all fabulous and would return.    "
"12903","One or two apartments may experience road noise during some times of the day but this is not a problem during the night and shouldn't affect quality of sleep, "
"12904","Found staying at the Sanur Beach Hotel a great experience.  Loved the fact so many exremely comfortable decks on the beach, and the water so clean.  I will be visiting again next year.  Great experience with no negatives."
"12905","For sure I will go again for more days when I have time.   "
"12906","We had connecting balcony rooms on the top floor and it was absolutely amazing!"
"12907","Great location right beside the main shopping area. . The room - for three people was spacious. We had an issue with a sofa bed, which was resolved without any fuss. The staff at Reception were very helpful and friendly. Because it was winter the hotel was quiet, but the price was correspondingly very attractive.Car parking is available - at a daily charge - below the hotel. If returning to Salamanca, I would once again use this hotel."
"12908","I want to marry this hotel and have babies with it. My boyfriend literally had to drag me from the room when it was checking out time. Stay here for the towels alone. Oh, the towels! As Agnes from Despicable Me would say, ""They're so fluffy I wanna die!"""
"12909","Very helpful and pleasant staff."
"12910","It's been a very nice experience and a good value for money."
"12911","Great location in St Julians but positioned on a street behind the main road through so still quiet, very helpful and friendly staff, very clean hotel. Great value for money overall"
"12912","The pool was out of action, but then we went in November so that was always likely"
"12913","Staff not interested in good customer relations. Too many times they popped out for a cigarette."
"12914","Room big enough for 2. Cleaned perfectly every day and complimentary bottles of water really appreciated. The bathroom is modern.  Walking down the street, the tram is just 5 min away. 15-20 min from Grand Bazaar. Breakfast really good, lot of choice and good quality. Coffee with milk delicious, first time in a hotel..."
"12915","Could hear some noises from neighbours.   If you're tired at end of day, the hotel may seem hard to reach on top of the street."
"12916","Neat and Tidy room."
"12917","Below average service. No greeting upon arrival, no eye contact. It appeared as both receptionist did not want to be there. "
"12918","Room is big and clean. "
"12919","IT service is poor. No wifi service password provided until 6 ppm.No room access due to access key problem. Check in only after 3 pm.  No tooth brush provided. "
"12920","Excellent hotel - smart, clean and in a great position. The staff are brilliant - very friendly and attentive."
"12921","Room was small but clean. Well laid out and lots of storage space."
"12922","Only one thin blanket was provided in the room, the pillows were very thin and slightly uncomfortable due to lack of neck support."
"12923","Very friendly and helpful personal. When we checked in we were given a presentation of the city and sights by the manager. We had a deluxe room with the most beautiful view over the sea and at the Blue Mosque. Breakfast could be eaten on the terrace on top floor with the same magnificent view. Remember to bring hotel address for the taxi drivers. "
"12924","The location of this hotel is great, you are within walking distance of the main area, especially the old town. The design of the courtyard is really nice and in Spring / Summer, it must be very enjoyable to sit there (I was there in November). The clarity in the room was nice especially in the bathroom (natural light coming from above). I did not quote the food as I did not try it."
"12925","Given that is a 5 star hotel, I was expecting to be provided with at least a complimentary small bottle of water in the room...this was not the case. The Spa area is nice but rather small and limited in facilities."
"12926","Clean , Conveniun , Easy go to Subway."
"12927","very good location  value for money  something different from the usual standard hotels"
"12928","Overall very good stay.  Good location and close to motorway and easy access to Birmingham city centre."
"12929","Car parking space not enough if there is any function.  Has been ask to park at NCP nearby, which is inconvience.  Also, some of the hotel reception staff need training.  Check-in and check-out time too longer than anticipated, eventough with a valid documentation.  "
"12930","WOW! - Absolutely perfect honeymoon destination. Staff were incredibly friendly and attentive- my wife and i couldn't have asked for more. The personal butler service made it feel incredibly special, and the welcome by the manager, the sparkling wine on arrival, the fact it was adults only, the beaches, the room, the location and the staff who all knew our names all combined to make it a holiday of a lifetime. Thoroughly recommended!"
"12931","Third time I have stayed here on vacation. Could not do better elsewhere. "
"12932","Exellent position for Haydock Park Racecourse, stay here every year for the November meeting."
"12933","Prices at the bar are to expensive"
"12934","Fantastic view.  good location"
"12935","Gym was so hot that it was virtually useless. until fixed you may say you do not have a Gym.  2 of 4 elevators were out of order so waiting  time 10 min to get up or down between 7 and 11 was an exercise of patience"
"12936","Central located, lobby spacious,  swimming pool version clean and tidy. Facing South China sea. View excellent. "
"12937","Great modern, welcoming hotel with spacious and very comfortable rooms.  Loved the mood lighting options in the room and the rain shower.  I booked another stay at the hotel online during my first visit, and will definitely stay again next time in London.  The no. 44 bus across the street passes every ten minutes or so and reaches Victoria Train Station within five minutes for underground connections to all of Central London."
"12938","Firstly remember this is Havana Cuba - with that in mind this hotel is fair.  Grand building reminiscent of a former golden age; sadly now in decay and almost of Cuba survives on day to day basis.  Main asset are the lovely staff so friendly, helpful and happy to help. Rooms basic very large and clean- stunning views of Havana. Great location. Food was poor but reflected again Cuba and the embargo that Cubans live with. "
"12939","No hot water - shame as the rest I was ok with as added to the magic and adventure that was Havana."
"12940","Not bad, we came with low expectations I guess, so we were pleasantly surprised by everything. Bed and bathroom was clean and comfy. "
"12941","Breakfast was fair - they had roti canai and curry which was good, the other food were just average, nothing stood out. Hotel location was not walkable to anywhere. Cab or drive to nearest mall is City Square which had many variety of food. "
"12942","bad service in main restaurant  rooms need reffresing  "
"12943","The Rooms were massive,tidy and clean. Close to the town and the station. As for value for money it was really a bargain. I really enjoyed my stay in the hotel and staff were very lovely and helpful. "
"12944","Nothing negative to say the hotel. Just Brilliant."
"12945","Charming hotel. I had a room at the top of the building with a nice view. The hotel has lots of courts and yards that you can relax in. The location is superb and close to the cathedral and the Alcazar. Children would probably love the place as it is a warren/maze. Lots of space to explore."
"12946","There is wifi but you can't use it in the room. Only in the public areas."
"12947","Very friendly and helpful staff. Good location, next to Komtar bus terminal where you can take the free city shuttle bus. Surrounded by 3 shopping malls. 10 minutes walk to open air good street at Lorong Baru. Hotel has free shuttle to Golden Sands Resort at Batu ferringgi. "
"12948","Hotel not renovated for quite a while. "
"12949","Very good service, nice restaurant, very good communication to the airport..."
"12950","Good Location, excellent choice for breakfast, friendly staff."
"12951","Rooms looking a little tired, not very good selection of TV channels, no hotel directory in room."
"12952","The room was perfect for us, I spent the time with 3 daughters and it was everything we hoped it would be and even better!"
"12953","Brilliant from as soon as we arrived until the morning we left all the staff could not have done any better 11out of10 in my opinion "
"12954","A beautiful hotel in an ideal location close to everything.  All the amenities were excellent particularly the Deck on the third floor which had the pool, spa, sauna, gym and steamroom.    Everything at your doorstep with the Crown Complex and Southgate  and walking distance to the exhibition centre, aquarium and a quick walk over the bridge to the city.  The Crown complex has four hotels so the place is always busy with cinemas, shops and so many restaurants, cafe's and everything in between.  We stayed for three nights and it was perfect. I would definitely stay there again."
"12955","If you have a room with window is not too bad (no window room is a torture, so be careful when you book as it is not clear, it seems that a standard room is one with no windows), though there's no proper shower (you shower in the toilet, splashing water all over the place). Internet is good and they gave the code to us for free (not sure is that is to everybody as on the paper slip with the code it showed a price). There are some bus connections that takes you to metro stations and some areas of interest. Swimming pool was pretty good. "
"12956","Staff at reception VERY unfriendly, with no sense of customer service (In fairness maybe 1 or 2 were average), but the rest of staff were awful, had to change 3 times to a different room and they were very unhelpful about this and send us with 4 heavy suitcases up and down the building. Cleaners were very friendly and helpful (certainly more than any other staff in the hotel), though they were a bit noisy at odd hours when cleaning rooms, you could hear them on the hall). No Metro station near by so a bit of a pain when trying to get around (Be aware, taxi drivers in Singapore are in their majority very rude and sometimes don't want to take you to where you want to go, or they take you but they seem very unfriendly, we have never experience this anywhere else). Also we found it difficult to find friendly people open to help tourist in the whole of Singapore (Except from BHS shop where they seem to train their staff on customer service) (Go to Malaysia or Hong Kong, we have been there in the same trip and we liked it better)."
"12957","Overall fair price for a good hotel. "
"12958","Really nice room, amazing roof swimming pool overlooking the skyline of Kuala Lumpur, comfortable beds and pillows, modern. Staff friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend it as it is great value for money."
"12959","Breakfast could have been better for the standard of the hotel, location not the most central but 5 minutes walk to Rail station (would take 20 mins to reach town centre). TV only had one channel you could see as antenna didn't seem to be working (Though we were not to bothered about it so we didn't even mentioned it to reception)."
"12960","Nice hotel, good location, great views and very good roof swimming pool, it is bigger than it looks on the picture and with views of the skyline. Good value for money. internet connection good. Very good breakfast."
"12961","Room very small but it seems that space in Hong Kong is a luxury. "
"12962"," A beautiful hotel in a great location, especially for shopping!"
"12963","The only negative was that the water was not hot enough in the shower"
"12964","This resort has beautiful rooms with sensational views of the Agung River and forests. The staff go out of their  to help. The breakfast was very good. Apart from the room service food (see below) the rest of the services were first rate and I would definitely stay there again"
"12965","the room service food I thought was average and reasonably expensive for what you got. The Asian dishes were quite good but the western food was quite small portions and not what I would call great quality."
"12966","Great hotel and amenities. Professional staff."
"12967","Blood on bed sheet, unmotivated staff, shower not working properly, broken equipment, unclean room."
"12968","Poor, at best limited breakfast for the category. Overall on the expensive side."
"12969","Staff were friendly and helpful. The position is great for most places in Copenhagen and for travelling further in Copenhagen and into southern Sweden. Wifi worked very well."
"12970","The room was very small, so we had to upgrade and even the junior suite was small.  There was no safe in the room, which we think is a must these days and  in our experience most hotels of this calibre all over the world have one."
"12971","Clean and well situated hotel "
"12972","Centrally located at Cape point so it allows one easy access to all major attractions. Warm "
"12973","Old aging infrastructure, carpet was wet in certain areas of the room safe not working furniture falling apartI it may need to  be revamped in the near future I won't mind paying more to stay at the  hotel, because it is situated in a prime location. "
"12974","Very friendly and helpfull staff in all depts.incl.massage ladies  only a few steps from the sw.pool,a few more to lamai beach  indeed very good value for your money,food ok,a lot to choose from  only 10 mins.walk along beach to lamai center  quiet "
"12975","A very steep climb up to the reception,however a good excercise for a minute or so"
"12976","A period building full of character features in a very good location. Across the road from Hyde Park, a 10 minute walk from Lancaster Gate tube and 15 minutes to Oxford St. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful."
"12977","The room we had was very small with a bathroom that looked dated, but it did have a view of the park and character features. There was a good breakfast selection but all of the ""hot"" items were only like warm."
"12978","Lovely building, superb friendly professional staff at Reception, Valet etc Christmas decorations made the lobby and building exterior very inviting and magical. All staff very friendly."
"12979","No Spa treatments whatsoever available during our stay, Food at Perrotts not great and definitely not as described on menu in all cases.  Despite pointing this out, items remained on bill.  TV channels in room really need to be upgraded and a mini-bar would be nice.  Otherwise a really special hotel."
"12980","The hotel ground was big . Rooms  are big. Breakfast was good. Staff was wonderful. Service was good "
"12981","The hotel's location is very good for the city centre. "
"12982","The check-in was quick but neither key worked the lift or the room door. We were room only but someone was taking breakfast and quoting our room number. We then had problems sorting this out with the reception staff. The room was pretty basic considering what we paid. The hotel has no parking and doesn't offer a discount at either of the two nearby long term car parks. "
"12983","Perfect location. Very nice and service minded staff. Every Sunday afternoon beach bar party with live music a positive contribution. "
"12984","Golf course grass and greens temporarely sub-standard. "
"12985","If you don't like cats don't have ground apartment as many come to visit during the day. Probably because visitors feed them."
"12986","Close to everything, perfect location. Lovely "
"12987","The best thing about the Celeste apartments is the location which is excellent. The staff are very helpful and friendly also."
"12988","Rooms are very dated and need refurbishing badly. Compared to other properties i have stopped in these fall well below the standard, the interior of the apartments seem to be stuck in an 80s time warp with poor quality finish. The hot water system was very poor due to having a very small immersion heater which was barely strong enough to provide a shower!! I would not stop at these apartments again when there are much better equipped properties for the same price or not much more expensive."
"12989","This review is for Delphin Habib."
"12990","Excellent staff,great location,very comfortable highly recommended"
"12991",".Some staff were great, some not so good. Great location for restaurants etc"
"12992","Some staff were great, some not so good"
"12993","The Chinese restaurant was outstanding although some of the dishes were not available by 830pm. The rooms are generous in size."
"12994","It's located in the old Havana."
"12995","We didn't like it all. Some off the staff are nice. But unfortunatelly the hotel is too expensive and try to sell you so many eccursions etc. We stayed for 6 days and that was to much. "
"12996","Great location  Funky loft style bedrooms  Good value  Great rooftop pool and sun deck"
"12997","Small rooms  Must book premium - bed downstairs versions very cramped"
"12998","good view and good service"
"12999","electricity off at some time  air condiction is broken"
"13000","All the staff were very friendly and professional. The shuttle bus to the waterfront was very convenient. We only had breakfast which was superb. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you"
"13001","No free wifi. Cost to purchase in the room is very expensive. Poor quality breakfast- flies all over the fruit etc. location is around 20 min by taxi away from Hua Hin. Not suited for young travellers as nothing to do in the area and v quiet at night!"
"13002","Perfect location, great room, cheap hotel, fantastic food and all good,  will go again   thanks"
"13003","Modern design, close to Silom Road, gay friendly"
"13004","Failed to give us King Size bed, just two singles joined together, receptionist very intrangient."
"13005","Great hotel. Excellent service, breakfast and bar food of a high standard - bar food excellent value for money. Generally a good atmosphere. "
"13006","My room was very hot and I did not get the radiator control right until the second night."
"13007","The Hotel is very centrally/conveniently located in the Brussels City Center, with Metro Stations as well as Railway station nearby. The upkeep of hotel is very good. The staff is very polite and helpful. "
"13008","A good hotel for a reasonably price in the neighbourhood of NEC."
"13009","Convenient location,close to restaurants,supermarket,on bus line. Enjoyed free mai tais,evening events were entertaining. Loved the fireplace by the pool at nite."
"13010","The hotel is in a nice area, close to the airport. The ground floor facilities are quite nice.  It was unusual to find an Iron and ironing board in the room. That was welcome."
"13011","Very good value for money, and centrally located especially if you want to drive further to Auschwitz as I did."
"13012","Sits on a very busy intersection. That didn`t bother me, but for some, might put negative spin on it."
"13013","Hotel is focused on the basic needs for private travelers.   A perfect location in the center of Wan Chai district. Train "
"13014","Size of the regular rooms!  Breakfast is very simple (if needed)  No changing room at the pool!  "
"13015","This hotel was very reasonably priced and in a perfect position for cardiff city center and the motorpoint arena. The staff were very nice and always happy to help. And my room was clean. And my room was basic but there wasnt anything missing that I needed. Ok so if you want fancy then dont come here but if you want real value the big sleep is the place!!"
"13016","very good will stay there again,apartment very clean, and great views."
"13017","The Staff at Metropolitan Hotel Toronto did not hesitate to spend the extra time with us to share their knowledge or information on great places to dine and also the entertainment available to us within walking distance. The Staff was very helpful to us."
"13018","Please do not put large groups of single men next to family rooms, very noisy. "
"13019","Great location, near tram station and taxi stand right outside hotel"
"13020","Cheap and cheerful! Excellent location for Motorpoint arena. You get what you pay for and the room has everything needed for a basic stay with no frills."
"13021","For the price we paid it was very good. and had nice aeshetic. Good sound proof walls and in a very good location. "
"13022","Sadly, upon arriving there was a mix up from the staff. We gave them the voucher (we had booked planning on paying at the hotel) but the receptionist thought that we had already paid. It ruined our evening because we were wondering what happened after all. The next morning everything was arranged by a very likable (different) receptionist. "
"13023","The staff were excellent and very helpful. They knew were everything was in the city and if they had not heard of something they were very happy to look it up and give us directions. It is very central in the city which makes access easy. I would happily recommend it to anyone."
"13024","Hotel is in an excellent area the beach is outside the back gate .you can walk to next resort along the beach front .The pool area is very large and the pool is excellent for swimming for all the family.You can find lots of bars and restaurants in a beautiful area."
"13025","Great hotel, top location, amazing staff, super comfy bed, excellent breakfast, fantastic value for money. Go!"
"13026","No lessons are given how to greet your customers extremely curt staffe . I won't say service was bad but never felt at home  I have stayed in many good hotels in china and I never felt so unwelcome. I will definitely not stat in tho hotel again "
"13027","What a fantastic place. Top marks for service, quality, food, location. Visit this hotel if you can."
"13028","Very good value for money, excellent location for city centre, and m.e.n arena. very nice room and large shower"
"13029","Breakfast a let down, poor choice of cooked items, very unorganised self service system!"
"13030","Beautiful hotel and stunning rooms. The staff have their work cut out when the weather turns bad and the resulting problems it can cause but they do everything in their power to ensure you have a comfortable stay. Food was wonderful and we thanked the chef for his hard work."
"13031","Problems are relative to the country so I can't really fault the hotel. The staff did everything they could for us during our stay. It's a beautiful and modern hotel right on the sea front (the Malecon) - which was closed most of the time we there due to waves pounding the coast."
"13032","Near to Heathrow Terminal 4, Hatton Cross underground,"
"13033","I have stayed in this hotel many times since 2002, alone or with groups of up to 30 persons. I love this hotell! It is Cuba! It is situated close to Havanna Vieja and in the popular area of Centro Havanna. It is cheap. But above all the staff is marvellous! You feel like in a family: a kiss on the cheek every morning, they ask you about your plans for the day, what you did the day before. There are Cubans staying at the hotell so you can talk to normal Cubans. I know that many guests think this is a terrible hotell so if you want to stay at fancy 5-stars hotell with  other rich tourists and very professional staff (without any personal interest in you, only in your money) El Hotel Lincoln is nothing for you."
"13034","Good location for red Dragon centre"
"13035","Charge a fiver to stay in car park overnight when other hotels in same area dont"
"13036","I can't say enough nice things about this property. Very clean rooms and public areas, wonderful and attentive staff and a great exercise room!"
"13037","Staffs were kind at the first day, but not kind in the secdond day morning.."
"13038","Well if we actually stayed in the 'Hampton by Hilton', which we actually booked, we would be able to give a review, but unfortunately when we arrived at the hotel, (early may I add so not anywhere near check in time) they told us they were fully booked and had to move us to another hotel!!  Unbelievable, especially as we had booked this at the beginning of October, and had researched and picked this hotel specifically for it's location, ie within walking distance to NIA, christmas markets and shopping centre, we weren't happy about this, and it also delayed our start to the day, because we had to go back to the car and drive around again to try and find where we'd been moved, which turned out to be a walking distance of 15 minutes further away from everything than our original hotel choice, not what the receptionist at the Hampton told us! Fortunately the hotel we were moved to we have no complaints about, other than the fact it was further away from everything, but we do feel we were unfairly treated, as we had booked this within plenty of time to be told they were fully booked, plus the payment had already been taken at time of booking!!  It will definitely make me think twice about booking there again!!"
"13039","Price is high, superior rooms need to be renovated as they are old.  "
"13040","Rooms very modern, staff very friendly and welcoming, breakfast beautiful"
"13041","Horible drain smell in room, paintwork in room starting to wear, couldn't switch the tv off using the remote and staff didn't know how to either!"
"13042","Hotel location good"
"13043","Easy access to shops  and restaurants."
"13044","This is a lovely hotel with large rooms. Although about 2kms out from the resort there is a walkway on the seafront for those who enjoy walking. The local bus stops outside the hotel. I would recommend All Inclusive which appears to be taken by the majority as it is such good value. Entertainment is laid on and is a variety suitable for most!  We travelled on the third week of November so generally only children under school age. As this is a very large hotel it perhaps could be different in school holidays! "
"13045","During our stay there were no negatives.  We had a very enjoyable holiday which we can only thank the hotel and there team for-nothing was too much trouble."
"13046","Staff were so friendly and professional, from reception staff to room maids and gardeners, everyone had a smile for you.  The hotel has one of the best hotel pools we`ve seen. It had seats and lying-in-water areas so that if wanted to be immersed but not actually swim for a while ,you could ! Plus a swim-up bar.   The hotel also ran an hourly shuttle bus for the 10 min ride into town  for only £1 pp, but you needed to reserve. "
"13047","Not a big negative but we thought that in these enviromently conscious days it wasn`t really neccessary to change bath towels every day and bed sheets every 2 days. The rooms had 3 level a/c so had no need to be sauna-like causing sweaty sheets !  In a similar vein, pool towels could be left for new arrivals in their room with a request to use for 2-3 days before renewal,all reducing laundry, and detergent use.   Couldn`t think of any real criticism ! "
"13048","I can't really comment about our stay at Hampton by Hilton as it never happened!!  When we arrived to book in we were told the hotel was overbooked and that we had been moved to another hotel.  I was extremely angry about this as we had chosen Hampton by Hilton purely because it was based on Broad Street, Birmingham, within walking distance of the Symphony Hall where we were attending a concert on Friday evening.  The hotel we had been placed in was not within walking distance of Broad Street so we also had to spend extra money on taxis to and from the venue in the evening.  Hampton by Hilton staff obviously never tried to contact yourselves to advise you they were overbooked so that you in turn could contact us about this.  All in all my stay in Birmingham was ruined by this experience and I would never book to stay at Hampton by Hilton or book another hotel through Hotelopia again."
"13049","Parking is not good, car park next to hotel full"
"13050","V nice hotel, worth a visit."
"13051","Entrance appears to be in the wrong place."
"13052","Lovely welcome from reception staff, in particular Francine, was so helpful and polite.  Excellent turn down service in the evening.  The barman on duty that day and evening was most helpful, particularly in organising lunch in the bar for our family and reserving a larger area in the bar for our evening pre-dinner drinks.  The Hotel is in a fantastic location. "
"13053","We had a nice evening in the Lyttleton restaurant, but thought the selection of just 4 main courses was very limited. The portions were rather small, however the food was of an excellent quality. It was most fortunate that we were allowed to chose some dishes from the bar menu. Some music would have helped with the lack of ambience."
"13054","Great pool and nice room."
"13055","Staff were really fab - we were only there overnight, but they still managed to impress in that short space of time - would definitely recommend."
"13056","Great location/pool, everything at your fingertips.  Received bottle of wine "
"13057","Stayed here for 1 night only as part of my granddaughter's Xmas shopping treat. Very good hotel, location fine, although not being used to driving in Newcastle we took a few wrong turns! Not the hotel's fault though. Staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant which was pretty good but might have liked room service. Not keen on the idea of ""tray service"" where you carry your own food back to your room. Overall a great place for an overnight, triple room was spacious and we weren't falling over each other. Spotlessly clean and comfy beds, great shower."
"13058","No room service and very difficult parking."
"13059","I have stayed here previously and the hotel is in a good location, though not centrally located on the strip.  The rooms are clean and I had a great view of the mountains from my room. "
"13060","There are not enough places to eat in the hotel, but do not let this put you off as there are many places to eat at nearby.   "
"13061","This hotel was very good value and was very convenient for the centre of Birmingham and its various attractions and shops.  The bedroom was a good size and spotless.  Breakfast was nice and the staff helpful."
"13062","Check which room you are getting as our friends ended up very close to the number of discos/night clubs in Broad Street meaning it was very noisy at night until they closed and the patrons had dispersed.  The breakfast. although nice, was extremely busy and one thing which could be improved is there was no room to place your tray whilst you were helping yourself to various items - this meant a balancing act was required unless you went back and forward to your seat with one thing at a time."
"13063","2 night stay which was fantastic for NEC visit and chilling out in the pool/spa. Great location, room was quiet despite the road outside. Food at the bar was good, generous portions and all the staff that we had contact with were very friendly. Hotel was in a good clean state. Excellent choice at breakfast. Excellent value for money."
"13064","Not so much negative as 'could do with some improvement' - decor and some furniture is a little dated, especially the carpets. At breakfast it would be good to be able to have choices of coffee, ie latte, americano not just tea and instant coffee"
"13065","We enjoyed the décor and cleanliness of the hotel but absolutely loved the location. The staff were very kind and allowed us to have a late check out which suited our needs and explained why when we checked in there was still cleaning and room service apparent in the corridors. This did not affect us and we would like to stay again next year. "
"13066","The shower doors were in need of adjustment to actually close but my husband managed to do that so we were fine and the shower was great. "
"13067","Despite two abortive attempts to check in earlier in the day as we knew we would be late arriving, we we finally told at 10pm that we had been overbooked. The hotel receptionist ( very stressed but polite ) informed us we were now booked in at the Hilton NEC where we spent an awful night subjected to an appallingly loud disco until 2 am. "
"13068","Very clean. Friendly staff. Room has to of space and cooking area useful"
"13069","Most of the staff where very friendly and helpful."
"13070","Didnt have are room cleaned even though we put the cleaning sign on the door. But once we mafe a complaint, they offered us an upgrade which was most greatful for."
"13071","Have a big truck  parking spaces for vw  had to park out front"
"13072","Clean, good location, friendly staffs"
"13073","before arriving i emailed the hotel to request to be in a room close to other family members who arrived the day before us.  we understood this was only a request so couldnt be guaranteed, but upon arrival we were pleased to find that we had managed to be in a room next door-but-one.  reception staff very friendly and helpful.  room cleaned every day, although there was a bad smell coming from the bathroom which didnt shift all week.. "
"13074","Worn down, worn towels, expensive WIFI."
"13075","the pictures showing has nothing to do with the room i finally stayed. and the 4* also."
"13076","Staff so friendly and lovely, good restful holiday.  Good buffet"
"13077","Go full board if poss, as do not have snacks to buy for lunch. had to pay for buffet lunch separate as we were half board and this worked out expensive.  Hotel is quite on its own, so cannot get meals locally"
"13078","In the hotel works very friendly staff. Hotel is good for solo or company travelers and cost not so expensive."
"13079","They should improve their conditioner system, if it can't create swimmingpool on the balcon and dirty building walls."
"13080","To be honest, the ratings are a little vague due to the fact that upon check in at the holiday inn Birmingham airport, we were told that they had no rooms available and had overbooked a number of rooms (our booking was 4 months prior to visit).  We had no option other than to transfer to the Coventry de vere at the Ricoh arena.    All in all a very poor experience at the hands of the holiday inn, and one which I will not allow to happen again."
"13081","Close to the city and nice view from balcony. Staff is great  "
"13082","Cleasiness was disgusting and breakfast was limited. I will not be staying there again or recommend the hotel"
"13083","good localisation, just 3 minutes walk from bus terminus."
"13084","cold in winter, there was no heater in the room. They asked me to change my room in the middle of my stay due to maintnance works."
"13085","Was able to make a last minute booking which made a saving of £23 on the night which made for fantastic value.  Even at the full rate I would certainly pay another visit and recommend others do the same. "
"13086","Easy to reach from the airport with the hotel shuttle bus"
"13087","Showerhead fells from the wall, therefore we were not able to use the shower until the next morning, when we had to change the room."
"13088","Facilities especially bathrooms need an urgent renovation."
"13089","Its called the airport hotel but it will cost you 10 pound to get there by taxi I tried to walk but you cannot cross the motorway on foot this hotel is located at the wrong side of airport in relation to the terminal building.  don't believe the b/s about a shuttle from the train station it wont be there?  the restaurant was completely understaffed it took 1 hour 22 min to get a chicken burger and a pint of beer.  the room was fine except it was underneath the function room which had a party till 2.30 am the music was so loud I had no  sleep at all ******* this hotel is a total washout********** my advice"" run a mile""   ***********"
"13090","central,clean,modern,pleasant staff,good value for city centre hotel,kids enjoyed pool  would stay again"
"13091","breakfast overall good but hot food could have been warmer"
"13092","Perfect location,so close to darling harbour with great. Owes of the city"
"13093","Rooms clean but need maintenance on them. Looking tired"
"13094","Excellent hotel, friendly staff and good location. Main square is about 15 minute walk. Couldn't fault anything, would recommend!"
"13095","Big roomy apartment, would stay again. "
"13096","Hotel was overbooked and I was transfered to the Hilton. Holiday Inn paid for the taxi to the Hilton and my destination the other morning."
"13097","I booked the Hotel two weeks before for one day and it was a special offer what was for  /- 79 €, what was not possible to cancel !   After having Problem with my teeth and a treatment i had to cancel the trip to Antwerp!  After informing the Hotel with my Problem and the attest of the Chirughie  that i had a treatment and could not attend the staying,i was told that this are the roles for the booking and they can not refund the money or bookit for the week after. However i went there , but because of this attitude it was the last time that i booked that hotel. In that case money is more important then the health of a Person and I'm traveling a loft for bussines, and this is not customer friendly at all  "
"13098","Room 403  The walls are paper thin - and was almost a participant in the nightime activities of the couple in the room next door.   I book a room mostly to sleep..  the bed is one of the worst I have ever 'slept' in. Consisted of two single divans with a mattress overlaid. Unfortunately, the beds were of different vintage with the result that I was sleeping na hill and got quite bad back ache; I only realised this later.  But the BIG issue was that there was a big party scheduled. okay - no problem - except that my room I was given was on top of the ballroom where this 'do' was going on until 2am - getting louder and louder; I complained, but they were hardly going to take notice of one guest when 300 others were also having a good time. Being by then extremely tense it was maybe 4am before I got some sleep   My beef is that the hotel was half empty - and yet I was given this room on top of where this event was planned - is ridiculous and insensitive. And makes me extremely angry. Basically I paid for two bad nights sleep - including one no nights sleep.   Probably the worst hotel experience i can remember. I stayed at a $50 a night hotel in Krasnodar the previous 5 nights - whom could teach Marriott how to run a hotel properly. "
"13099","The staff is wonderful !"
"13100","friendly and courteous staff. rooms fairly spacious and clean"
"13101","décor a little clinical and lacking in warmth"
"13102","The hotel is far away from city. If you dont like the city or nightlife, this hotel is perfect for you  Breakfast is ok but not various"
"13103","The room we stayed is a little old"
"13104","Reception staff were professional and courteous. "
"13105","Mouldy bathroom. Uncomfortable bed. No extra pillows. No power points except for the tv. No Wifi at all except in the lobby which was very expensive. Room fittings in desperate need for a renovation. One tiny lift for whole hotel. Breakfast until 10am but by 9 everything was finished except for plastic wrapped 'toast' and fake juice. Definitely not a three star hotel. "
"13106","Nice and easy to find "
"13107","Wonderful resort and room"
"13108","Small ants in bathroom and beds"
"13109","Full of old world charm, plenty of character including creaking floor boards. Comfortable bed and very clean, great central location."
"13110","Rooms at the front of the hotel would be very noisy.  Rooms are too hot and air conditioning noisy,"
"13111","Very nice hotel with excellent spa facilities!  "
"13112","Great breakfast, Nice room, Good location, Happy Hour, Right price"
"13113","No free wifi - expensive if buy"
"13114","Ideal location, fantastic hotel, wonderful staff, can't fault this hotel - all hotels should be like this! "
"13115","Enjoyed our stay in the holiday express "
"13116","Comfortable accommodation friendly staff would stay again"
"13117","No coffee in room  Only basics in bathroom!!"
"13118","*Good location.  *like the fact that it is an appartment, not just a hotel room.  *Cheap"
"13119","slow to react to room requests   on site dining expensive compared to    outside hotel"
"13120","Price of hotel was good so i wasnt dissapointed although taxi into town is 15pound so i would reccomend the bus."
"13121","Was greeted at checkin with enormous queue of people.Reception staff didnt quite seem to know what they were doing and each guest was at reception at least 5mins that is if they could find your name,hotel is looking a little tired.Bathroom had the customary curly hairs in it."
"13122","Friendly staff, easy access to TTC subway system. The North York Centre is located right across the street. I would recommend to my friends."
"13123","A simple Hotel with everything you need for sleep, shower and morning meal. You get what you pay for."
"13124","Last visited this hotel 9 years ago and this visit found it as good as the first time.  Staff very helpful, rooms clean and well maintained and breakfast lovely. "
"13125","Every time, we´re seeing that the management tries to change one or another.  We were there so many times and sometimes, 4 times a year and so you all know, that we´re very happy with this location, the atmosphere, the personal etc. etc."
"13126","No negative things about the hotel, but about some of the visitors.  I can´t understand that a lot of visitors leaving the breakfast table, with ....a lot of food they took, but the eyes were greater than the mouth. Further not thinking about cleaning the table a little bit or something like that?  No, walking away and leave everything, as it was during eating. I´m so pity with te girls, working there.    The same story outside on the terrace. Having a cup of coffee and walking away. Why not bring it back to the diners room.  Smoking a cigaret and well, for taking an ashtray, you have to walk a few meters.So, you´re throwing every thing on the floor, because?   I can´t understand this mentality and I don`t like it.       "
"13127","Nice, well designed interior. "
"13128","Staff are hard-work - dont try very hard to be accommodating. None of the restaurants were really open, and the bar and then the sheesha lounge closed very early. For what it is, it is highly over-priced.  "
"13129","It is my 4th stay at the Lancaster Hotel as normal the  staff very professional and efficient. Very clean. Great Location.  We booked through Hotelopia and was very sceptical at first after reading bad reviews of web site.  All I can say they were the cheapest price for the Lancaster, we booked a twin room with full english breakfast at a good rate and every thing went smoothly.  We will certainly use this site again. "
"13130","the hotel has a very nice and modern setup and the room is large"
"13131","although I request for non-smoking room, the 13 th floor still smells of smoke and it comes in from the ventilation to the room and takes a while to clear. I suppose there isnt any non-smoking floor. I'm also surprised to find that guests can actually smoke inside the hotel and even at the lobby cafe when places everywhere are discouraging smoking indoor.  Also although the pillow cases are changed they still smell like they havent been aired for a while. Changing the cover didnt take away the smell and it was difficult to feel homely and sleep with that"
"13132","Great base for Disney, free shuttle from the hotel. Self catering in room made great value trip. "
"13133","The restaurant ( dinner) : The food was fairly good , but the accessories were very small or incredibly small portions . For example , toasted salad ( 1 tablespoon) mashed potatoes ( 1.5 tablespoons ) meaning ""child portions"" .  I 've stayed at the hotel several times , but there are 2-4 people who eat dinner.  It seems to me that , if there is a customer that he / she "" get charged "" and therefore go "" all out"" to dinner .  This place goes to "" twice"" , it is "" first and last "" because prices are so high that scares the customers. Prices are 70-80 % higher than they should be.    Lobby Bar:  Last time I stayed at had the vodka, 3 ml whiskey , 7UP and coffee. This time it was 7UP and coffee. Both times I asked Gin and tonic.  The answer was ( both times) : "" Then you must go to restaurant ."" This must be the only hotel with four stars who have not Gin .      Restaurant / Dining :  The food was fairly good, but the accessories were very small or incredibly small portions. For example, toasted salad (1 tablespoon) mashed potatoes (1.5 tablespoons), meaning ""child portions"". Food quality is sometimes very good, but the accessories and price are only eligible for two stars, and Lobby bar is a total 1-2 star.  Breakfast:  Ukrainians complain about the breakfast, but I eat continental breakfast, so for me the breakfast was OK.  However, they should replace the coffee machine for coffee is not hot, it is lukwarm, and it was also 2 months ago.  Finally, this is probably the only hotel I 've stayed at where breakfast is from 08.00.  Kaare Lindbaek (member of: Châine dês Rotisseur)  "
"13134","Great position near just about everything you might need in Sydney. Food was great and the staff were very professional.  Very clean. The view and atmosphere on the rooftop pool was fantastic especially at night.  Beds were pretty comfortable."
"13135","The gym facilities were quite frankly a joke and in some instances some equipment either didn't work or may have been dangerous given it condition.   The showers in the room did not have a floor to ceiling screen and no lip on the tiled floor so when you had a shower the entire bathroom floor became one huge puddle becoming slippery. "
"13136","Old bathroom and area not so good."
"13137","excellent all round. A great find."
"13138","Difficult to find. Surroundings buildings run down. Heating not working fully in our room but we changed rooms and the new one was fine."
"13139","Great location, clean rooms, quality breakfast along with jazz music. A memorable experience overall"
"13140","Some people said the hotel was out of town.... WRONG!! It's about a 15 minute walk to china town markets, 7-10 minute walk to the monorail station/ sent real station where you can get anywhere from here!! Iit only costs 8 Rm to get from the centre of town to the hotel which was great too...!  We didn't eat at the hotel but the facilities were great, we would have stayed longer here but the price went up. Overall great hotel."
"13141","Great hotel lovely staff great location"
"13142","It was very close to where we wanted to be."
"13143","We had to call security, when we were awakened 3 or 4 times during the night with loud people, barking dog and someone banging on doors. We were also unaware when we made our reservation that we would have to pay for parking. I thought it was a little pricey. Since returning home I have found several other hotels that I think are a better value for our money when we visit St. Louis again."
"13144","Friendliness and helpfulness of staff. Hotel location along with the lovely sea views. Very secure hotel, not once did we feel unsafe. Mexican restaurant very good for quality of food and staff."
"13145","Hotel needs to decide to either stick solely with all inclusive or ditch it completely as it is effecting the quality of service given due to certain staff being fed up with all inclusive guests. Hotel could do with another variety of restaurant as buffet is very repetitive and there are often queues. Rooms could do with an update and fixtures replacing due to damage and wear tare. When maintenance were notified about problems such as broken sofa bed, no staff arrived to fix it. However housekeeping fixed the issue."
"13146","No hot water in the shower for 2 days evebthough i tell  reception to fix it or change room  "
"13147","Happy to stay at this hotel after having HORROR experience with other hotel. Hotels.com where very helpful with my booking on this hotel. And i am thankful for having booking.com as a partner. "
"13148","Restaurant was ok not the greatest but good to have that option when you don´t want to go out for dinner."
"13149","Should be one of the best accomodation in the area"
"13150","Only one night so couldn't find any negative!"
"13151","Close to Shah Alam, quiet place, suitable for holiday, comfortable room.   Immediate action while power failure and room not too expensive"
"13152","Far from shopping mall and no food stall around"
"13153","New design hotel, from junior suite great panoramic views to Vedado, sea and El Morro, no problems with noise from Malecon, silent. Comfortable bed. Good Terral breakfast - something different from the offer in other Cuban hotels."
"13154","In the terracce only table but no chairs. "
"13155","I got a great last-minute deal and this meant that, although I was traveling alone, I was given a large family room - my choice of beds, big bathroom. It was bliss! The staff on reception were friendly enough and the hotel was easy to find. My room was lovely (apart from the size) and was well equipped with a TV and tea/coffee making facilities. The window was sound-proofed, which was a real blessing on such a busy road (and not that common in hotels in that area of London) and the air conditioning worked a treat. Inside the hotel was very clean."
"13156","On the walk to the hotel I was getting a little nervous about where I was going to end up as it's not the most salubrious part of London - but the hotel was much better than expected, even if a little shabby on the outside it was very pleasant within."
"13157","Although within walking distance of Bath town centre there was a good bus service to the centre and railway station from outside the hotel. Staff were helpful and attentive and every where was always clean and tidy. Continental and/or Hot Buffet breakfast was adequate and tables were cleared quickly.   "
"13158","Excellent location, only 20 minutes walk to Newcastle city center.   Immaculate clean and very welcoming staff."
"13159","Only small car park for size of hotel."
"13160","Fabulous Room.....we were very impressed....great value."
"13161","Good view, good terrace,nicely situated. Nice and calm.good restaurantants, service also good."
"13162","location good"
"13163","all is generally fine , was surprised when I was told by reception there is no internet or email facility at the hotel ! when  you could see the  stuff itself before you....... "
"13164","It is located at a really calm pleace and the people are friednly in town. "
"13165","Staff very friendly and helpful.  We didn't eat breakfast as we had an early check out.  Organising a van for delivery to airport was excellent."
"13166","Friendly staff  Nice pool deck  Good location"
"13167","No return guest recognition  Noisy from street  Often problems with lifts   Room cleanliness average"
"13168","Good value for money.  Conveniently close to (1 mile) Lake Buenea Vista Outlets for some serious retail therapy and the Premium Outlets is not much further.  Reasonably clean.  Breakfast was OK by comparison to other local motels but not as advertised."
"13169","Faultless! amazing service, beautiful hotel, great location.  Amazing breakfast!  Can't speak highly enough of our stay here.  Will be back to try afternoon tea next time...didn't get there during this stay.  I think the Regent would be my first choice now in Singapore, I have stayed at many of the 5 star hotels over the last 10 years or so, they are all good, but we really loved our stay at the Regent."
"13170","Hotel has no Guest Service at all. They are asking all the guest relaxing in beach front and laying on their beach bed around 4:30pm to leave the area because they need to set-up their buffet dinner. No hot water in the room and for make-up room, the guest needs to inform front office that the guest wants to make-up their room, I asked front office to make-up the room but they did not do it. When i ask them why they did not clean the room, its because that i need to go to front desk and sign in their log sheet so they can clean my room. The food is no good, but its okay because the price is very cheap. I think most of their staff are OJT (On the job trainees) and they dont know what guest service means. I will not recommend La Carmela de Boracay. Very Bad Guest Service."
"13171","Clean and perfect location"
"13172","This hotel is perfect if you want somewhere clean near sentral station. "
"13173","Very efficient friendly reception staff. Very warm and welcoming. Good location in Richmond."
"13174","This is my third stay at this hotel. It's position is great, right next to the Planty and only a few minutes stroll from the central square. Also only ten minute walk from the main railway station. The bedroom was small but warm and clean and recently upgraded I would say. Very good value for money"
"13175","Air con leaked.  Ants in bathroom. Rooms not great value for money- a little too rustic for the price paid."
"13176","junior staff at reception excellent  OLDER staff not bothered,we lost a bag off our coach at the hotel at the hotel,they told us not to worry,this was the last we ever saw it ,junior staff tried ,older were not interested.we were there for 10 days,4/5 looking and phoning to try and find it ,last day at the hotel  no transport arrived we had to take a taxi to the airport 45 euros"
"13177","1. Unfriendly and unhelpful staff. 2. Noisy aircon. 3. Water on windowsill and broken window closers that don't close properly. 4. Dirty coffee station. 5. Faulty (flashing) lights in room. 6. No Wi-Fi signal. 7. Asked for non-smoking room and got a smoking room. 8. Fungus growing all over the bathroom. 9. Food quality not good and served with raw roast vegetables (at a premium). 10. Curtain fell off the rail. 11. Price tag and labels still on towels in bathroom."

"13181","near the sea, good friendly room service"
"13182","monotonous food, especially at breakfast;rooms clean, but needed repairs. Poor Wi-Fi! This hotel oriented for seniors, but not for younger people or family with children (most of guests like from retirement pension)"
"13183","Very happy with the room - spotlessly clean, modern and comfortable.  I asked for a quiet room and they very kindly obliged, putting me right at the end of the corridor away from the lifts. Would definitely stay again."
"13184","The lifts really do takes ages to arrive, and the front desk service was fairly uninspired, but still efficient. "
"13185","Central for location"
"13186","From the moment we arrived in the door, the staff were extremely courteious and friendly to us. We found everything about our stay to be so warm, friendly and relaxed.  We will definitely be recommending our friends and neighbours to stay there.  I always like staying in the Chester area, and so now we have somewhere where we know we will be well looked after.  Please pass on our compliments to all your lovely staff.  I am retired early, from having spent over 36 yrs in Customer Service in my career, so I do know how important  the "" CUSTOMER "" is every business. Thanks to all again. "

"13191","Location great.  Staff vg.  Bedroom OK.  Breakfast great.  Great views from our 7th floor room towards Cardiff bay and beyond. Car parking very cheap though limited in size but managed to get a slot.   Also very good view from the breakfast room into Cardiff CIA/MotorPoint Arena.  Good security.  Hopefully be back soon.  Entertainment in the room was good (TV).  Bathroom VG. "
"13192","The hotel is good. We book a family room and a standard room for my in law almost 80. They are enjoyed the pool and massage. And my two kids also very enjoyable and asked me if can come for next holiday. "
"13193","We booked this hotel in good time (months ago) but in the last minute they said that they had ""over booked"" so we had to change hotel in the last minute. Very stressful and we were dissepointed   "
"13194","Managed to get twin ensuite inc continental breakfast for £40.  Easy to find and managed to walk to all tourist attractions without needing to use any public transport as The City of London is smaller than you think.  Free WiFi not sure how secure it is though."
"13195","No confirmation of reservation received, emailed but no reply so had to call to confirm booking. They didnt think i had breakfast included so had to show reciept as proof that I had paid."
"13196","shuttle bus is too small to accommodate only around 16 people.  the interval time between bus is too long at night"
"13197","Pleasantly surprised after reading some of the reviews.  Check-in was easy, no hard sell of the timeshare, a simple ""no thanks"" and that was it.   Room was clean and decor much better than expected.  Would definitely stay again.  Great value for money.  "

"13204","Had 4 days reserved but only stayed 2 days due to the storm. I was told I would get a refund since they had no internet or cable due to storm. They told me that Hotelopia had not paid them yet so i still have not recieved a refund or even a call from resort. I hope they don't do buisness like this and not stand by what they promice. Thanks Steve"
"13205","in down town"
"13206"," no internet  no breakfast  the manager was very unpleasant (no help, no information)  "
"13207","This hotel is not a 4 star but a 3star"
"13208","It was very good and clean .  And good transport to the park from the hotel."
"13209","Rooms are so cold. The heat didn't work."
"13210","The hotel and the facilites were fantastics.  The personnell were nice and friendly.  We had beakfast at the hotel was really fantastic. We don't know of anything that we didn't find.  "
"13211","Positives  - Very good value for money.  - The hotel was comfortable and well equipped for the price we paid.  - The room was well sized, although it must be mentioned that we did get a free upgrade to a triple.  - The hotel was quite centrally located with only a short walk to the old town.  - The staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English.  - The room was very clean and well maintained.  - The breakfast was an extra expense at 50 zl per day but it was good quality food and therefore good value for money.  "
"13212","Negatives  - NOISE. There was both internal and external noise pollution which negatively impacted the quality of our stay at the hotel.  - There were multiple hostels on the same road as the hotel, therefore it was usual to hear noise from drunken people returning to their hostel in the middle of the night.    - The hotel was located on a busy road with a tram line at the front of the hotel. Whenever a tram when past, one could feel the whole hotel vibrating. The trams did not run during the night but they did re-commence at approximately 6 AM.  - There were also shops next to the hotel and therefore there was noise from early morning delivery vans.   - Inside the hotel, there was very poor sound insulation between the rooms. One could easily hear the conversations of other guests through the walls, even when they speaking at a normal volume.  -  Parts of the central staircase were not carpeted. Some areas of the central staircase where bare stone, meaning that loud footsteps could be heard in the middle of the night.   - Other guests often returned to their rooms in the middle of night talking loudly and they woke us up. Kraków has a busy nightlife so it is normal for many people to return to their rooms very late. Usually this is not a problem for us but as I said before, this hotel had very poor sound insulation.     Conclusion  - There are a lot of positive factors about this hotel. But unfortunately, we would not stay there again because it was noisy and this lead to a poor sleep experience. I would rather spend extra money and stay somewhere quieter.    "
"13213","I booked this hotel based on price and location. I received my voucher advising me that I would have to pay the price quoted at the hotel which was 64 euro and 10 cents. The hotel charged me 69 euros and told me my voucher was incorrect and I would need to contact Hotelopia to sort this out. I contacted Hotelopia by phone and by email and still have not received my refund. This is most disapointing and I will not use this website again. I also found the Manager at the Pearse Hotel very unhelpful and was not customer care friendly."

Room cleaning was less than acceptabke with dishwasher suppkies not replaced in the last 3 days. We also ran out of toilet paper and was forced ti go to reception to ask for more."
"13220","A great place to stay. Staff very accommodating! Very handy to Britomart and down town Auckland. Will stay again!"

"13250","Choice of two restaurant and a bar/cafe to socialise in on sight and a large breakfast area as well.  Staff were very welcoming and quick to respond to your needs.  I was very please with the breakfast team as well as the variety of food on offer as well.    I had an executive room on the third floor for the duration of my stay (5 days) and it was nice and quiet and the rooms was cleaned every day.    I ate at the Parkland Restaurant (the on sight restaurant) twice during my stay, and found that the food was of a good standard.  There was one occasion when I asked to speak to the manager and made my comments to him about their new menu, which looked very good.  He was very receptive about my comments and even when I made a comment on how they might improve on their layout of their menu, he was very professional in how he handled my comments.    I will definitely visit the hotel again"
"13251","No negative comments. This is my second stay at the hotel in the last couple of months and I have enjoyed my stay each time.  "
"13252","Nice room, brilliant location, quick and timely checkin. Breakfast was a good however very busy but as it was near Christmas this was to be expected.

Recommendable hotel for a experienced traveller who is aware of the fact that circumstances in Cuba do not always allow to maintain western standards. Spectacular views towards Malecon and over Havana from upper floor rooms. "

"13283","Amazing hotel and great service! Cannot believe this hotel is only 3 star it should be 4 star. It's so clean and the staff are very professional. Ordered a taxi to take us to the clothes show and we were provided with a Mercedes. We felt like VIPs. Will definately stay here again next year or anytime I need to be in Birmingham!"
"13284","My sisters allergic to feather pillows and no one seemed to know if they were or not. Only minor and wasn't an issue but would be handy to know next time"
"13285","This is a very good hotel in a very central location. The hotel is very American like and has old world charm. If you like modern, chic hotels (W style) this is not the place for you.    I recommend the hotel for demanding business travellers and couples who appreciate top quality hotels. The room is spacious and the marble bathroom is wonderful. There is a lovely bath tube and a separate shower corner in the bathroom.     There is a spa with steam room and turkish bath at the hotel but please notice that there is a separate fee of 25 euros each for entering the spa premises even for hotel guests (not for suite guests). This is disappointing.      There is a lovely bar at the hotel. It was very popular during the Saturday evening with many locals as well.     Buffet breakast was very good and highly recommended.  "

"13292","No were in the preview about the hotel does it tell you the pool is at the hilton 100 meters away and that you have to leave a £10 deposit if you wanted to brave the rain and wind to get to it. Our room was not booked even though we had confirmation so got a family room with far to many beds and not much room to move about. No mirror near the very few plug sockets. Had to boil the kettle on the floor as lead did not reach the plug. Couldn't use the largest bar /Cabaret room as private function on. Paid £58 for all the facilities it offered and couldn't use any may as well of booked a £25 bog standard room in a smaller hotel. Very disappointed in the very false advertising spoilt our plans and night away. "

"13300","Not in the main tourist centre if that is what you are there for so a 20min walk (which is not bad really), small lounge /bar area, breakfast was busy due to small number of tables......so nothing too negative really! If you want good value and not too concerned about lots of extras / high level comfort (eg leisure facilities), then this is an ideal hotel to stay in for a short break as we did (4 nights)."
"13301","Very accommodating. For the price it was very good value. Duty desk manager was very polite and helpful"

"13310","Excellent customer service, the staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. The overall safety nod relaxed pool and beach areas were great for our 9yr old girl to explore.     We were able to relax and enjoy all the fun the resort had on offer. Would stay at the resort again for sure "
"13311","The staff was quite helpful, polite and well mannered. "
"13312","Air conditioner in my room needs improvement. Did not find it very effective. "
"13313","I was not given the room I paid for. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told that managers are not available at nights and that I would have to wait into the next morning. The next morning at check out I asked to speak to a manager and was told that managers are not available in the mornings. I was told that a manager would call me regarding a refund for the error on my reservation. It was been 3 days and no manager has contacted me. When I called them, all they said was that a manager will call me back."
"13314","The price and it´s near the centre of the city."
"13315","The heating system is poor and the  hot water isn´t warm enough."
"13316","Excellent location and staff were very friendly and professional"
"13317","There were only two lifts and two days running the lifts were broken at breakfast time.  We stood 25 mins one time waiting for a lift as the only lift working was used by staff.    Like other hotels the prices went up during Thanksgiving weekend.  It cost $282 dollars per night when normally it can cost as little as $124."
"13318","Right on the Carihuela, a fantastic position overlooking the sea.  Easy walking distance to bars, shops and restaurants.    A very welcoming lounge area with attentive waiter service.  Lots of choice at breakfast.  Free wifi. Bathroom spotless.    Spa is a real bonus, and treatments are good value.  We had hired a car and there was a small inside car park next door, where hotel residents got a discount down to €10 per full 24 hours. This meant the car was safe."
"13319","No rugs on the floor so can get a little noisy if someone above you is walking around or moving furniture.    In room safe was chargeable rather than free.    Otherwise a great stay and recommended."
"13320","We found the staff helpful, the stay was very good and the location excellent.  Melbourne is a very easy city to get around and the location could not have been better.  Good value for money.    "
"13321","Location is nice. Hotel is near Aquapark and Kleopatra Beach.   Around the corner there is a nice market called Migros.   Only 15 minuts walk to harbour area.   If locations is important, this hotel is a good choice. "
"13322","Rooms are old and scuffed. The smell of tobacco is everywhere.   There was a fridge in the room but it didn't work.   Water is heated only with solar power and during my stay in December there was't any hot water in shower. Maybe same thing in the summer time if there are cloudy days...?"

"13327","The facilities in general, simpel food, small rooms, small breakfest areas, almost no place to rest or relax but in the room, the staff gives you almost nothing attention and one of the small indian restaurant just around the corner could not be thrusted for the price for the food and turned out with a much much..higher price for dinner..Most things can Get better, but is was ok. Next time we will put more money in better hotell."
"13328","Fantastic location, fabulous view from room, first class breakfast. Would recommend."

"13334","Loved it. Wonderful and welcoming staff. Nice atmosphere that made you feel right at home (classy without being too posh). Clean and fresh, noticable that they've undergone a renovation. Good location which will be even nicer when the park opposite of it is done. We would definitiely stay again if going to Miami. "
"13335","In general the staff here need to embrace customer service more highly"
"13336","Beautiful hotel with lots of facilities.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Great location.  At approx £50 per night for two half board it's got to be a bargain."
"13337","On our previous trip the choice of food was better.  Tea and coffee facilities in the room would be nice.  Wi-Fi could be free for what it costs the hotel.  Food (buffet)could and should have been hotter."
"13338","-Friendly staff  -Nice and clean room with air-condition  -Nice looking hotel"

"13356","The staff were almost all very charming and friendly. The gardens are well maintained and the access to the beach is great. The sun loungers are comfortable and there are beach umbrellas. "
"13357","Our bed had the most awful badly sprung thin mattress so no sleep for the first two nights. We asked for an upgrade that we were happy to pay for. Unfortunately there was no availability. Eventually we got a better mattress and could sleep. We also requested a kettle 5 times which was never supplied so we gave up.   The breakfast service was chaotic with a struggle to get a cup for coffee. Some days the selection was good on others there was little choice. We only had one dinner there because it was so disappointing. The food outside the hotel in local restaurants was much better. The fact that we had to pay to have the use of a safe in the room and for internet access was a bit mean considering that we had paid the full rack rate for our stay. Other hotels nearby were less expensive and included both these services in their rates. We plan to go back to Kotu which is lovely with beautiful people but not to this hotel. We do realise this is Africa and this is not our first time to an African country or the third world. The outstanding plus is the people. "
"13358","Clean room, but too hot!  staff welcoming"
"13359","breakfast although provided was passable but missed bacon and poached or fried eggs, i hated the scrambled. yak!"
"13360","Location, good facilities, comfortable beds"
"13361","Short opening times of the bar / restaurant, room service only in the evening.     The hotel disperse a scent into all public areas (inklusive rooms), which works with fragrances / flavour. This not only smells unpleasant, but can also have have health consequences for many sensitive people. I hope that the hotel turns off to disperse a scent. At least this should be featured on the homepage and the outside of the hotel."
"13362","Definatly can do with some renovation as the hotel is aging "
"13363","The rooms are very spacious and well maintained. Confortable beddings and pillows. Nice view.  "
"13364","The food at the restaurant Chatterz is average. The freshness of food is not tip top. Due to high human traffic, the staff had a hard time maintaining cleanliness and tidiness.   During breakfast, the salad greens are not really fresh, you can see the edges of iceburg lettuce turning brown. The food items were not topped up in time to manage demand.   During buffet dinner, the items served for seafood hotpot were not fresh too, the meat were dry and hard. Seafood were not cleaned properly. We had to even wait for long time for soup base from initial to subsequent top ups."
"13365","nothing at all"
"13366","They didn't even know about my booking and that was on a Sunday. They told me to call back reservation on Monday 9am while my booking and arrival was on a Sunday night!  The blow dryer in the bathroom seriously needs to be changed, I think they had that since 1970!"
"13367","""We liked the apartment and location enough the first time that we went back for a several visits, which we rarely do and enjoyed it as much as the first time. Out of season it really is fabulous value. The kitchens have 2 hobs, microwave, electric kettle, toaster and fridge, plus dishes, glasses, utensils and pans; bring small bottles of dish washing liquid and cooking oil rather than having to buy huge bottles when you arrive. There is a dining table for four in the apartment and a plastic table for two on the balcony. The bathroom is large, with bidet and bathtub/shower. Some bedrooms have twin beds and some have a double bed plus the two sofas in the living/dining room become single beds. The heat pump (10 euro deposit for the remote control) is in the living/dining room not the bedrooms which can affect comfort if it is very hot or cold outside. The TV has a few Portuguese channels, good for finding out the weather forecast and BBC World News. The Continente, Lidl and Aldi just 10 minutes walk away are very useful. While I find Portimao and Praia da Rocha to be small enough to walk everywhere, my wife does not but the city bus service Via e Vem has stops on Rua Jaime Palhinha just 10 metres from the front door of Mirachoro II.   "
"13368","This is supposedly one of the best hotels in Conakry. For such a high price it anyway should be. It's dirty, things are missing anywhere, the taps, the flush, etc..... and hardly any internet at all. Although we had paid by your site, the hotel answered by phone that there was no room for us (although we had already the booking confirmation....) until finally we could get our rooms. Normally there should be a shuttle, but arriving at Conakry airport, they asked me to take a taxi because of the heavy traffic....all by all a bad experience...."

"13371","Hello, the hotel can not too pretty from the outside but very comfortable and great for the whole family up to 6 and 7-aside. Apartments spacious and really clean. Every three days staying exchanged towels, linen and cleaning of the apartment. The food at the pool restaurant excellent and highly recommendable. In contrast, pure water heated in the winter is great. The reception staff in particular deserves recognition because it is very helpful. He can provide all the information you need for just what especially thank you."
"13372","For the negative things I can include only three things - the lack of a playground for small children and the lack of inside the hotel felt I mean corridors-gutters when it rains the water then pouring everywhere and no inside these corridors garbage , which must be outside the hotel for the other side of the road. But it is not that inconveniently. For wanting nothing difficult so this third negative do not worry. The bigger problem may be the location of this hotel on a hill. When we go to the city is great but the return may be hard for people not to walk lubjacych. My family and I like to walk so it does not pose much of a problem even with shopping and a little child 2 years. I would recommend this hotel to everyone because at Tenerufie in Los Cristianos rarely rains and playgrounds are on every street so and so children can play. The other hand, is priced cheaply for comfort. Regards and recommend to all."
"13373","Probably the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. The whole place is spotless. My only complaint was the size of the bed which was a small double, it's not something I would expect in any hotel and meant our sleep wasn't as good as it should have been.     It's in an ideal location with the Arndale, Printworks and main shopping street all just around the corner.    The breakfast which is included in your price is very nice and sets you up for whatever you're doing that day. Would definitely stay again despite the size of the bed."
"13374","We had a suite for 4 adults which was excellent"
"13375","Very clean  Helpful receptionists and waiters  Good breakfast  Pleasant restaurant"
"13376","Small rooms and bathrooms  "
"13377","Beautiful room with five star location. Pool and sauna was great and the lady looking after the area was very helpful and pleasant"
"13378","Concierge service was only available from 11am and for a few hours only. This is pathetic service for a top hotel. "
"13379","Very friendly staff, warm welcome and helpful throughout.  "
"13380","Bathroom door didn't fit so couldn't be closed properly, breakfast area was very busy, noisy and cold"
"13381","The central location, the beach is perfect there; most members of the staff were really gentle and professional"
"13382","The kitchen staff usually looked upset and disgusted, as doing their work against their will, no wonder the food was so bad, even for normal Cuban standards"
"13383","Super friendly staff at all levels; housekeeping especially efficient. Excellent buffets. Great hotel location for most activities, if one likes being in a city center area (Kowloon). Convenient access to metro, buses, trains, ferries. Hong Kong hotel rates are much higher than 10 years ago, but this one is still a good value."
"13384","The staff was so friendly and helpful at all times! Always smiling and so wonderful. They really made us feel welcome. The room was cleaned twice a day. We were given several free water bottles every day and good beach towels every time we went to the beach or stayed at the pool. The food was good and one night we had a wonderful BBQ-party at the hotel."
"13385","The hotel has it's own beach which was very nice. No screaming kids or people who try to sell you domething. Just peace. But the minus side was that the beach was a little dirty. I think some of the garbage comes from the water and it's impossible to collect it all, but if someone could check the cleanliness of the beach once or twice a day, then it would be perfect!"
"13386","nice hotel with pleasant bars"
"13387","mix up at check in...took some time to sort out"
"13388","staff is just terrible  first i had breakfeast included and then the other day i had to pay"
"13389","Had a fourth time. Always get a great vacation and only positive emotions! Thank you very much!"
"13390","Very basic room facilities for this day and age. Tired 80s feel. No iron, fridge, shower gel. For the money I'd expect more. Guess you pay double for Central(ish) London. "
"13391","- location (city centre in walking distance, groceries shops, restaurants..)  - airport express bus stop just in front of hotel  - food of very high quality  "
"13392","- some rooms are very noisy (you can hear your neighbour word by word)  - even in non smoking rooms you can smell cigarette smoke through ventilation"
"13393","Character, history, culture, quiet in room but right in centre location minutes away from the Ann Frank House on adjacent to Dam Square"

"13399","very nice and clean hotel with enough facilities"
"13400","Literally ' in the middle of nowhere'  except for the airport, 30 minutes   traveltime to anywhere, poor public transportation"
"13401","Very nice and professional staff. Big rooms. Good situated ( near old souk )"
"13402","This is a modern hotel (about 12 months old, I believe), with good sized rooms and well appointed rooms. Nice touches include such things as the en-suite toilet have a separate door, thus avoiding waiting while one's other half is using the bathroom.    The breakfast is buffet style and caters for a wide range of tastes. Not 5 star, but what one would expect from a hotel of this standard and very acceptable. Food in the restaurants is very good - a la carte as opposed to buffet selections are very clearly freshly prepared to order - and again has a wide enough range, including a limited ""fine dining"" range in one of the outlets.    The swimming pool and gym are both very adequate.    The staff are amongst some of the most friendly I have come across and are very keen to assist. Two of them told me how proud they are to work for the hotel, a rare thing.    Overall, an excellent hotel and we would stay again."
"13403","Although it is close to KL Sentral, getting there on foot is not easy, nor is access to the old KL station, from which it is possible to catch the underground. I had not realised this when booking, though the hotel does offer a free shuttle to both KLCC and KL Sentral.     Room servicing (e.g tea "
"13404","Fantastic hotel with modern funky rooms....super comfortable beds and pillows. Loved our time there and would definitely return. Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful."
"13405","Breakfast was a buffet but was exactly the same every day. A slight variation of options would be nice."
"13406","very convenient "
"13407","We never stayed here because when we turned up you hadn't made the booking.You did put us up in a different hotel but we really could have done without the hassle."
"13408","Fabulous staff, they really could not do enough (keep this up it makes such a difference!) the cleanliness of the hotel and my room could not have been better super! "
"13409","The staff were friendly, and the massage chairs (paid) in the lobby are great. Lobby is very clean and modern. Cleaners there are nice ladies. A/C is fantastic."
"13410","The rooms were old, ""dirty"" and smelly.  The bathroom was tiny and I didn't want to shower in it but had to because of the duration of stay.  Parts of the room were dirty, like behind the fridge/drawers and inside the cupboard where the spare toilet roll is kept, there was a lot of dampness (the roll was soaked for a moment I thought someone had done it on the roll).  The rooms smelt like really heavy dust - esp near the curtains, and near the A/C there was mould on the ceiling.  The beds are comfy but I took my own pillow cover as they were stained a bit.  Looks much better in the pics than reality.  "
"13411","The room was clean and looked new. Had a good nights sleep and was looking forward to getting my breakfast. Although I seemed to be the first guest in the restaurant I was meet by a lot of loud chatter. I didn't understand where it came from until I realized it was from the staff. I assumed that that things would quiet down now as the staff would realise that the first guest had arrived, but sadly not. I was asked if I wanted tea and coffee and that was that. Anyway, the management should have a word with the staff to turn the volume down a bit."
"13412","Very polite staff and very clean hotel."
"13413","Hotel was excellent value for money and the staff were superb.   I have previously stayed at an Indigo hotel which I enjoyed and again I wasn't disappointed"
"13414","The staff at the hotel are very friendly and professional. The beautiful female waiter at the breakfast on Dec. 12 with the blonde hair was very service-minded. The hotel should be very happy employing such a good waiter. It was indeed a pleasure staying at the Mercure Centrum Hotel, and will definetely stay there when coming back to Warsaw."
"13415","We stayed in a 2-bedroom apartment. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. The kitchen had all amenities we needed, such cutleries and cooking equipments. The front desk Assistant Manager, named Marie, was very friendly and helpful in providing us with maps and tips on where are the best places to eat and shop. Overall, it was a splendid stay and we will definitely revisit this hotel when we are in Perth!"
"13416","The hotel was in an excellent position, just a few minutes walk from central station and Tivoli Gardens. Breakfast was  good, lovely very fresh bread.  Reception staff were friendly and the hotel had a nice feel to it.  Although room was quite small, it was clean and had a flat screen t.v. and tea and coffee making facilities. I would stay again and recommend it to other people."
"13417","The bathroom did not have a shower tray and no matter how hard you tried the water flowed over the floor thus making the floor wet through. "
"13418","Location was good for us, as we were visiting Notting Hill. The frontage / reception is pleasant and the staff were welcoming and helpful.very little noise from other rooms / the corridor (helped by our room being at the end of a corridor). Cheaper than other hotels."
"13419","The room was basic and tired. It reminded me of student accommodation - especially with the basin outside of the ensuite and practically next to the bed. After flushing the toilet, there was a small leak from the ceiling, dripping on the floor (which can be quite disturbing when everything else is quiet."
"13420","Very cold, small pool. Closth nerly the whole week. No garden, nothing to do in hotel, the bar mostly clost. Our flight was erly and we had promise to have light breakfast whit us. But, no. "
"13421","Staff all v professional and helpful. Quick check in and departure   Even though some rooms overlook station you can't hear any trains if window closed"
"13422","Excellent hotel, would stay there again. "
"13423","Hotel food/drinks prices need to be competitive as many option available within short walk outside. Need to ensure standards kept up."
"13424","Overall the staff was very helpful and pleasant."
"13425","My only negative comment is that the cleaning staff did not replace toiletries on a regular basis.  "
"13426","Great hotel, location, rooms, staff, food etc... you name it."
"13427","A bit noisy sometimes when they have weddings/parties on the grounds..."
"13428","Amazing views of the city especially at night. Had friends staying in a two bed apartment and the views were equally spectacular. Room a fair size with floor to ceiling windows. Great bathroom with walk in shower and separate bath and toilet very modern. Food in one of the restaurants Neuvo 37 fantastic have been there twice. "
"13429","When we first got there a bit of a grey area about where to park but once the hotel advised us about using DFO car park and getting a discount it seemed logical. "
"13430","The staff were very attentive even received a bottle of champagne and chocolates for my hens night. Had a great time wish we could've stayed longer. It is part of the crown casino so we had fun all night then it was a short stroll up to our room."
"13431","The view from the window wasn't great "
"13432","Great friendly staff , good location, staff v helpful"
"13433","Clean and warm. "

"13437","tv reception bad, lifts were very slow, funny odor/smell at the pool level"
"13438","The Staff is really very friendly and the hotel is situated on the right spot.  "
"13439","Really excellent breakfast buffet, especially for vegetarians as everything is so clearly labeled as either vegetarian or non-vegetarian. This is the first hotel I have seen that does this... Bravo! "
"13440","This hotel is pretty good, and probably very good by Cuban standards from what I've heard.   I found the staff polite and helpful.   The shuttle bus into the old town is very prompt and efficient, running four or five times a day.  The internet is a bit frustrating, but mostly usable if you just want to check a few emails or something like that. (That's about as good as it gets in Cuba from what I've heard.  It's 5pesos/half hour (about $5/hr)).   "
"13441","I guess you should expect a few minor grumbles when travelling in Cuba, and mine were pretty minor, but here they are:   (i)   Check in is not at 12 midday as stated on the site - it is at 3.30pm  (ii)  Rooms aren't allocated according to what you booked, but what is available when you check in. If you booked a room view, or a room in 'the levels' (aka 'servicio royale'), then make sure you get it.  (iii) I paid extra for a room in 'the levels' or with servicio royale, paying about 30% extra for this.  However, most of the additional services listed on the melia site didn't happen.  This didn't bother me too much, as I was mainly only interested in the free wifi, but is a bit annoying.    (iv) The gym isn't very good.  There are no locks for the lockers, only two running machines which are mostly occupied, and only a few light dumbells. "
"13442","Good value for money room nice and clean spotless white bedding very comfortable. Breakfast good plenty of choices.nice quiet area of London. Good transport links very good dining places around the hotel.will certainly book again"

"13444","ideal location for anyone wishing to go to Wembley arena or stadium.not too far from Wembley park underground station.staff very helpful and curtious.room was lovely and warm.food was first class.will visit this hotel again in the future."
"13445","hoped to get a car parking space not told when we booked that you had to pre book instead we were told to go to a ncp car park which cost us 23 pounds   for overnight parking"
"13446","Love staying at the crown, best resort facilities i have encountered. Great restaurants, great food (dont rate rockpool though)  I feel great when staying at trhe crown"
"13447","Can get very crowded in hotel lobby and surrounding, entertainment areas on friday, saturday night.  Pool and spa staff/management a bit spaced out and unproffessional."

"13450","Staff especially on the reception were not nice at all, very unfriendly. "
"13451","The pool area was really clean and a pleasant temperature, sauna and steamroom very clean also.  The breakfast was one  of the best I have had cooked in a hotel for a while with good sausages!  The room was clean and whilst a bit basic was perfectly adequate and comfortable, bed was comfortable too.  "
"13452","As with lots of hotels price of wifi was extortionate and should be included.  "
"13453","Poor check in, I was not informed about the wifi nor was I informed that my parking ticket has to be verified at reception before going out. Verifying the parking ticket in itself is an inconvenience.  Pool was dirty and uninviting"
"13454","Fantastic for our stopover on the  to the south of Spain. Three course dinner including wine on Special Offer made for a very economical stay. We will use again and recommend to others."
"13455","Temperature in the bedrooms a little too low for December."
"13456","We were very pleased indeed, staff were friendly, price reasonable and breakfast in the morning was good.."
"13457","Very friendly staff   Very clean room  Tea coffee in the room  Checkout 12 was perfect   10 min walk to a lovely Xmas market in front of the castle  Plenty of resturants and cafes take always in the area  "
"13458","Staff was pleasant and professional. Beautiful resort and beautiful guest rooms. Very comfortable bed and many in room amenities."
"13459","Checked in at 4pm room wasn't ready till almost and hour later but got a higher floor than expected. Room phones were terrible and didnt last more than a few minutes without dying. Many stains on carpet and furniture. Freezer drawer on fridge was busted. Took  too long to get ahold of anyone through the phone"
"13460","Close to Hyde Park and Queensway Station. Clean rooms, good breakfast included, good value for money."
"13461","Room was close to the reception so lots of noise from other guests."
"13462","Special location in the water, on the beach, and in the middle of the little center, el Medano. Superior room with perfect view and sun on the balcony. Large room. Clean room and clean floors without carpets. Good value for money with half board. Friendly hard working staff."
"13463","Not the newest rooms and furniture in the bathroom, but it did work. If you don`t like the sound from the waves this isn`t the place for you. Slow and unstable wifi."
"13464","Great location by rushcutters bay and marina. good clean rooms and excellent staff on reception nothing is too much trouble for them, with special mention to javier !"
"13465","Very professional reception staff, Jimmy who attentively attended to my queries."
"13466","Nice environment and large resort"
"13467","The room had strong bad smell and not very clean, even so after we changed to another room. The spa and steam heater didn't work. The buffet breakfast was aweful and very limited variety. The villa and spa suite area was very far away from the main resort and felt like ignored and isolated from the hotel. Experienced twice that the water supply stopped while I was in the middle of a shower. Complaint twice and then was told that the hotel would stop the water supple and the fix the water pump every night. Was furious. The hotel should have notified the guests in advance during check-in."
"13468","Great well located hotel. Beautifully decorated for Christmas. Will be back"
"13469","The Betsy is a beautiful hotel with a great historic facade, located at the end of a strip of amazing hotels and bars.  The location was perfect to be able to walk the strip and enjoy the nightlife of South Beach, but far enough away to feel that you had escaped from the madness into this classy enclave of sophisticated elegance, with excellent service and superior food. The quality of the dinner at BLT Steakhouse was beyond our expectations, and would highly recommend it to anyone whether they are staying at The Betsy or not. "
"13470","excellent position for Lowry centre and outlet,very handy for tram into Manchster"
"13471","modern building, modern shopping centre where it's located; modern interior, but scrappy after closer look."
"13472","no usual things available in hotels such as hairdryer, iron. You have to ask about everything.  My bathtub didn't have a plug for baths.  Quite cold inside although both radiators were on max in my apartment.  Worst was slight noise coming from the ceiling even when the hotel card was not inserted into activation system. It was excruciating "
"13473","Thank You IBIS Malioboro for making my stay an excellent one!  The hotel location, the helpful staff, the food are incredible!  Staffs are friendly, hotel/rooms are clean, the nearby shopping mall and facilities are wonderful!  Will recomend others to stay at IBIS Malioboro! Thank You!"

"13476","This is our 3rd visit we really enjoyed our stay . Staff very helpful ,friendly .Rooms very modern "
"13477","Had a meal in the bar which took almost 50 minutes to arrive and was stone cold when it did. Certainly not good value!"
"13478","A beautiful resort beach hotel - clean, very comfortable, great staff.  Got an EXCEPTIONAL price for our stay from Hotelopia!  Folks in Trinidad could not believe the price I got - Thank you!"
"13479","Good location, scenic sea view"
"13480","Hotel is getting old and needs refurbishment. Mattresses are hard, sofa and carpet soiled."

"13482","Good facilities etc swimming pool,decoration "
"13483","Too far from main road.  Have to wait until 4.00 p.m to check-in..late 1 hours.  Furniture old fashion and hotel exterior not so clean.  Located on main land not pulau pangkor as per address."
"13484","Convenient as in shopping n food"
"13485","Good location from Paddington station. A short walk to Hydepark. Very sentral."
"13486","I am annoyed by the fact that a $50 charge is taken from your credit/debit card on check in  to cover use of the refrigerator I assume, and after one week, this money still has not been returned to my account. I can understand the reasoning behind this charge but why does it take so long to return my money to my account."
"13487","Great family location, lots to do, and having all those pools made it not so busy.  Very good place to take family, will go again."
"13488","Staff/cleaners need to check all crockery for cleanliness.  Nearly everything we got out of the cupboard was dirty, had to wash before we used it."
"13489","very good location, fine rooms, helpfull staff"
"13490","No facilities for food but available in the immediate area"
"13491","Lovely corporate feel hotel"
"13492","You don't at all get a disney feeling, very corporate feel with circus stripes . No circus entertainment at all and lots of coin operated rides but would be very expensive to stay with rides at 2 euros each. "
"13493","The location was really good. Just next to Hyde park, close to underground stations. "
"13494","The hotel offered NO cleaning at all (only if you stay for more than 1 week) and wastebuckets have to be carried out yourself. Besides the bed was soooo small (120 cm x shorter than 2 meters) and you hear every sound in the house.     There were many details of the hotel that we could not see on hotelopia -for instance about the cleaning, bedsize, that you have to pay 5 pounds to store your luggage after checking out and so on. Hotel staff claims that everything was stated clearly when we booked the hotel, but all of these things are not listed in hotelopias webside. Then they claimed that hotelopia forced their  into their webside, and because the hotel did not have ANYTHING to do with hotelopia, they could not help what information hotelopia showed and did not show. I'm not buing that!   If you are fine with a really small bed and no cleaning, then the hotel has a good location. But for that price I will choose another hotel next time I'm in London;-)"
"13495","No free wifi on all spots. At least at public areas I.e restaurants   Free wifi only at the lobby."
"13496","Breakfast selection could be better.  More tv channels required."
"13497","House keeping needs some attention.  We requested towels and pillows on our arrival as we were 4 in the room and they only provided for 2.  We eventually fetched towels ourselves but never got the extre pillows that we requested daily.  Basin drain was blocked.  Was reported on Friday but not tended to.  Safe was not working, reported on Friday but not tended to.  Stairs from the parking area to reception was littered with take away containers and chips packets from our arrival on Friday up to when we left Monday Morning.  Security at complimentary parking serves no purpose.  We drove in and out without being stopped.  Doubt that we'll make use of this facility again."
"13498","The hotel is modern and the rooms were very nice. The decor of the hotel brings a nice welcome (due to the Christmas season). The rooms were nice and the layout good with a nice view of the mountains. As it is near to the MTR station, it was easy to get around as well."
"13499","Apts and surrounding areas kept clean. There's an option to go A.I for a reasonable price of €19 per day whick includes all meals and local drinks. "

"13504","I went with my 2 daughters, 11 and 13 years old. We were most satisfied with our stay, and the facilities on the sight.  I have been in Kyrenia several times, and this was a nicer stay than we explored at an other hotel on a stay before tatying at Malpas."
"13505","Can not see that I noticed anything very negative at al. The staff were most helpful, and polite in deed, and this matter to me and my family the most. The room were clean, bathroom, and the food was actually very good. The only negative remark, might be the entertainment, singing when eating - it is sometimes a bit to loud for my taste."
"13506","Hotel was in a good location and clean"
"13507","As lime most hotels too warm and there is also a humming noise all night"

Booked 4 rooms for 14 people 3 quads and 1 triple asked for single beds, they gave us 3 mattresses on the floor about 3cm thick, the showers were cold. The stairs are dangerous to walk up and down and are outside and broken, the driveway is full of motorbikes so have to walk around the long  all the time and carry luggage out. The tiles around the rooms on the outside are so slippery went wet the kids kept falling over. Would never stay here again. No kettle to make a cup of coffee, the pillows dirty, mouldy hard "
"13518","the hotel is very nice and modern, staff is helpful and kind. I liked my room very much, and had everything i needed for my stay there. bathtube, tv, comfortable bed made my night in the hotel perfect. the room was clean and the price is also fine, compared to other hotels close to airport. Airport is 5 mins away and there is good transport possibilities by busses that are not expensive and take you to the right terminal in heathrow airport."
"13519","air condition works very fine, but is loud which makes sleeping difficult. there is only 30 mins of free wifi connection, after that you have to pay. what i also didnt like was that i got a drink from the hotelbar in a dirty glass. Or else the hotel was very fine to me and i could recommend it to everyone."

"13536","The hotel does not look a lot from the outside but the room, which was a superior room, was very large, and had air conditioning..  Always plenty of hot water which was a bonus.    We have no complaints taking into account the price we paid.  The area roundbout in the Latin quarter was really lovely."
"13537","christmas market food was excellent and staff were extremely helpful and pleasant"
"13538","Excellent for the price and very clean. Staff very friendly.  Had breakfast at the hotel cafe,no complaints anywhere :)"
"13539","Friendly reception staff, surprised to be accomodated in the Annex, but was pleased  at the high Standard of room, and felt very secure with the doors and Card System of accessing room. Excellent Location when using the one of  many shuttle buses from Airport, and Sightseeing. Would recommend to anyone on a Budget . Good value."
"13540","I ahve been already 4 times in this hotel. never had an upgrade..."
"13541","Staff are helpful and well trained."
"13542","Hard beds.  Our room was on the 4th floor on the St George side and there was a lot of noise after 10:30 pm each night."
"13543","Really excellent position for all the amenities of Puerto De La Cruz. Brilliant restaurants on the doorstep."
"13544","However  there was still building work going on in the room above, so if you wanted to sleep in, no chance.  When we told reception but they did not help much, we were told floor 12 and below were fine.  "
"13545","Hotel still refurbishing rooms above 14th floor, noisy in the morning and afternoon"
"13546","good location  Quiet  Good bed"
"13547","Lack of experience from staff (not always friendly with customer)"
"13548","Great Location. Easy to use Hotel Hoppa Bus. Great Price."
"13549","It was a place to rest our heads and was acceptable for one night. The staff were nice but not overly professional."
"13550","The shower didn't work properly and kept turning itself on. The floors were cracked and peeling and they charged more than we payed for the room to do a small amount of laundry."
"13551","The cleaning were awful - they took my passport and then they say ""it fell inbetween my beds"" WHY DID THEY TAKE IT OUT OF MY BEDROOM???"" I had a panicking end of my holiday in Agadir...and then they came to me in the reception 5 min Before I was going to Marrakesh...Will never again live at this hotel...."
"13552","We requested a room with a view as our stay was for a special occasion and we were treated to an amazing room with a great view and a complimentary bottle of wine with a lovely card wishing us a nice stay. Pleasant, professional and helpful staff at a modern, clean and well situated hotel."
"13553","Bar prices are a bit steep but to be expected in central London. However, the additional bar service charge of £1·50 was cheeky considering we were sitting at the bar!"
"13554","Good view and good service."
"13555","Was very good.  Clean and nice Staff.   Very Helpful when I called ahead of coming.   We were picked up at the Airport and brought to the hotel.  They also provided for us to go to the Pier to get on the Crown Princess and did not charge us for it.  Some of my family stayed at the Princess cruises facilities and had to pay from the airport and also, had pot and drug dealers in the hotel along with noise most of the night.  They were not happy.  I went with Comfort Inn and the Hotelopia and could not be anymore pleased. "
"13556","very clean and spacious room, has good access to shops and shopping malls"
"13557","Very good location and room had a nice bay view. Room very comfortable for just 1 or two people. Good selection of TV channels"
"13558","Wifi was an extra charge of 350 pesos per 24 hours and for two adults and one 4 year old child no extra bed was provided. Hotel lobby area lacked seating and sometimes very difficult to get a taxi."
"13559","Many russian people, a lot of them got drunk or took too much from the buffet without eating it.  Drinks from the bar in plastic cups."
"13560","- Cleanliness  - Budget Friendly  - Good location  - Very good facilities"
"13561","- I needed orientation for the bus station to catch the bus for the airport and only one of the staff members helped me being oriented and be at the airport on time.  - There should be some shower gel, cotton buds, shower caps and things like this provided for the guest in their rooms.  "
"13562","The personale at reception were mostly professionel and friendly."
"13563","The other personal (cleaning, in kitchen) were not so professional.  You have to ask for, every time the soap is finished."
"13564","Excellent breakfast, close to a variety of places to eat, within walking distance of tube into Washington DC."
"13565","Efficient staff, clean, modern, well situated"
"13566","The hotel condition has detoriated from what it used to be.The receptionist. Was unprofessional"
"13567","very clean and well presented. breakfast buffet very good, "
"13568","no free internet, pool not heated in december as hoped for. walls very thin, need a car to stay there"
"13569","Fabulous central location close to the river with lovely views of the bridge.     "
"13570","Great room but best was the sun deck and view that comes with it. "
"13571","We arrived at the hotel to be greeted by two smiling faces.  The reception was very welcoming and after missing a connecting flight, it was wonderful to find out that the location was away from tourist and very quiet.  I was born in Cuba and it was my first trip back in 27years, and I was travelling with my husband who is Australian.  I would highly recommend this hotel and thank you to the people at reception. "
"13572","There is nothing negative about this hotel. "
"13573","the room design and facilities are very good. the balcony is also great."
"13574","one bad thing, really a bad thing, is the noise cancellation by the door is very poor. every morning i wake up early because of the footsteps, door slam, talking ... and every noise you can imagine in the corridor."
"13575","Conveniently situated near a park intersting shopping."
"13576","Nothing negative to say about the hotel, but your website leaves a lot to be desired.   Too complicated and lacking essential information.   Will not use your company again, more easy and user friendly ones available.  "
"13577","cafe staff attitude are bad especially the man with spec.disappointed breakfast ,the food only refill when it empty. not much variety . not convenient place, no hawker, no restaurant , unless you want to spend more and eat in the cafe with the lousy food.  bed bugs , ants etc on the beds. my son whole legs with all the ants and bed bugs bites .  cabin - dirty, ants, bed bugs, mosquitoes etc. not suitable for family. and not worth of money.  tree house- think like giving children hv gd experience staying n tree hse , but end up gain a lot of bugs bites.   this is our first and last stay in permai. will not come back again.  this permai not the right choice to stay..regret of choosing it.   my advice, pls avoid ..and think twice if u really wanna to choose these resort for your holiday. you will get suffer instead of enjoy.  "
"13578","Very helpful staff, excellent food and great rate."
"13579","This hotel is very good value for money. The rooms are small but big enough if you are just sleeping there. The cleaning of rooms was of high standard and towels and linen were good quality and changed regularly. Very good shower with nice hot water every day.  Breakfast was fairly basic (from Western point of view- eggs, cereal and toast but no fruit and yoghurt) but staff there very helpful. Fanny looked after us very well."
"13580","Friendly staff, clean modern hotel"
"13581","Great location, front of house staff professional and friendly"
"13582","Second time I've stayed as first time round I was delighted. Disappointed this time with the room considering the price. Bath battered and tired and a very very slow filling loo. Staff said the hotel is going through a referb next year. The price would have be very good for me to go back."
"13583","Staff were helpful. Would definitely stay there again."
"13584","poor room service and destroyed bathroom. also cold water in bathroom and the heating was very poor. "
"13585","Nice clean place, quality peaceful stay. Can do a lot better"
"13586","Too many mosquitoes and the food is very bad"
"13587"," Hotel is not new. It is one of the oldest hotels in town.  This is shown in rooms and facilities.  However everything is clean and well preserved.  Very friendly staff and manager.  Food delicious.  Felt very welcome and at home. Guests behave as if they are family.  Every afternoon free tea/coffee and pastry for all guests !  View over harbour and town OUTSTANDING !   Situated in one of the most lovely places in town.  Near to shops, harbour, beach.    "
"13588","Only one little thing is missed a littlebit : evenings there is really nothing to do, no animation at all.  Maybe it would be nice if they could arrange some nice, not too loud, live music or something.  Just to entertain the guests a littlebit while they are having their last drink before going to bed.  That would be very nice. Now you have to go outside to other places in town.  "
"13589","Room lacked basic facilities such as no shelving, no electric socket in kitchen for kettle, and whole bathroom flooded after shower. "
"13590","very noisy (and unnecessary ) music around the pool area.    Grab a pool towel when you can - they are rare!!"
"13591","It was a pleasant stay. rooms were spacious and clean. The Jim Thompson room was very nice. "
"13592","If you are driving the signages to the hotel is very  BAD. Something needs to be done to improve that.  The breakfast was yummy but a selection would have better. As in a buffet. For the price if RM70   I expected more from breakfast. "
"13593","There was nothing negative, everything was just as expected."
"13594","Très propre (Very clean), Proche du centre-ville   Facilité d'accès à pied (Closed to the center   Easy to go there by walking), Wifi gratuit (Wifi for free)."
"13595","The tour bus stops right in front of the hotel, which is a plus if you plan to have a city bus tour."
"13596","I understand that this is a very old hotel and has not been renovated at all for decades. However, at least they need to maintain the place 'clean.' I cannot understand how they've received that many stars. The hallway of the second floor was really dirty and almost felt like a haunted house. The rooms were even worse. The windows did not close and had power outrage. We were moved to another floor with better--I mean with power and closed window. The worse part is the buffet. No hotel flavor at all.  "
"13597","Fantastic experience, every member of staff were very helpful and nothing was a problem (special thank you to Monika from restaurant and Maria from reception)."
"13598","Beautiful room however it didn't have a proper shower but only shower attachment. Restaurant little bit over priced. "
"13599","Good location breakfast good"
"13600","Parking to tight and to dear"
"13601","Nice resort, friendly staff, nice quiet place. Villa has infinity pool and small kitchen "
"13602","Nice touch Gluhwein for christmas. "
"13603","Hard to find!"
"13604","Room not cleaned patio filthy not light in fridge, no window in master bath,poor lighting in kitchen, bedding not changed hair in bed,no phones in room except for master bathroom stayed in room 110 then kicked out and put in the supposed show room 120, lost 1 full day, poor attitude when the problems were brought to their attention. I should get a full refund instead of dishonest apologies with lack of concern. Not even a gesture to rectify the situation."
"13605","Unclear directions as where you are supposed to check in, took us an extra 15 minutes to find right building. Staff not friendly or professional. Better accommodation in the London Bridge area for similar price."
"13606"," The IN hotel in Penang. Good location.Good service . Spacious Room.   "
"13607","The first thing we noticed about The room was how Very Clean "
"13608","Unfortunately there seemed to be a problem with the plumbing at the basin because the water drained slowly.  There were younger children staying in the room next door, and at times through the night loud sounds could be heard through the wall....very annoying when you are trying to rest/relax/sleep."
"13609","The room was spacious."
"13610","Great position, great discount  rates, paid parking available and buffet breakfast really varied."
"13611","Lifts can be confusing -especially when trying to get to the car park, it would be simple to resolve this with a few notices inside the lifts to explain use of card keys, which floors are reception and car park levels and the 'no exit to car park' in one lift,"
"13612","Fantastic breakfast, proffessional and attentitive staff"
"13613","I good hotel, centrally located in San Jose, i"
"13614","The hotel is central, I wouldn't go out around the hotel at nite,safer to get taxis that to walk."
"13615","Food was nice, selection fairly reasonable and the staff in restaurants and Cuba bar were good and very professional.   Location is good, there are other restaurants and shops around.   Beach is beautiful!"
"13616","1) Extremely bad experience with booking via Hotelopia as the room booked was not in the main body of hotel but across a busy street in separate building with no access to beach, pool or anything else. This was not indicated during the booking process!!!  This problem has been resolved after escalation to the hotel's general manager.  2) Hotel needs urgent refurbishment, it is definitely not 4* but in Europe this would be 2-3* at best.   3) Staff at the reception needs training in Customer service care."
"13617","the room was very cold - the room card key also is used for the electric so the heating is only on when the room is occupied. We stayed on a very cold night in December and it was obvious the room had not had any heating for some time it was so cold - the heating system was very noisy. There was a electric fire in the wardrobe which we pulled out and used to try and get warm.  The mattress had seen better days and sagged in the middle - One of the worst nights sleeps I have had at any hotel I have stayed at.  There is no parking and the car park they recommend is further away than expected we were lucky it wasn't raining."
"13618","Friendly staff, highly recommend "
"13619","The breakfast buffet need to add more food selection "
"13620","service is good, clean, comfortable, location very good!    "
"13621","Funky interiors and spacious.  Staff all delightful.  Well located.  Hosted wine evenings and coffee mornings a great idea."
"13622","Very nice rest time!"
"13623"," the hotel was in a beautiful riverside location not far from city centre and travel links.  our room was superb with fabulous views over the river, baltic art centre, sage theatre,  millennium and tyne bridges with views across Newcastle. all of the staff went the extra mile to assist us and they were most professional and friendly.  there was ample secure parking and access to main roads was very accessible.  it was certainly value for money as we got an excellent rate through the travel agent on line.  we will certainly return in the future and recommend the hotel to friends and family - a most enjoyable stay wish it had been longer !!!"
"13624","Park Royal is very good for a 4 star hotel as during our recent visit to Singapore, we stayed in a couple of 5 star hotels as well and were able to compare."
"13625","The hot water was not available for one whole day, of course a mishap, but staff were not able to tell how long it would be before we got hot water.  My wife was not pleased. Some sort of compensation, other than offer of free breakfast, would have been more welcome as we stayed 7 nights."
"13626","The Location of the hotel is very convenient. The apartment is big enough for a family. The staff at the reception were very friendly and helpful. We got right information about the city. The hotel is quite clean and has good facilities."
"13627","The sofa bed was not such big for kids over 8. For an extra bed for kids we should pay 160 MYR per night, which is very expensive for one kid. The quality of the breakfast is not goog, but value for the money."
"13628","Enjoyed our stay here. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable and serviced each day of our stay. We like the location for its ease of access in and out of the city by car and its convenient site so close to the Waterfront.A excellent choice for someone who wants a no- frills place to stay in Cape Town"
"13629"," Our only negative was that the Hotel had been told by Hotelopia.com that we would pay direct to Breakwater Lodge  when in fact we had payed by credit card at the time of booking so there was some minor confusion which was dealt with very easily."
"13630","The Breakwater lodge is conveniently located with easy access to the V "
"13631","Currently the restaurant facility was being revamped so breakfast was held in an alternative location, most days the hot breakfast was barely hot and on some days it was cold. The only other issue was the return shuttle service ordered to return to the airport seemed not to have been booked even though it had been confirmed prior and on the morning of departure.  "
"13632","The room smelled like cat pee. The toilet did not work at all (even after feedback) -- had to use bucket to clean up after. However, this is not very exceptional in Cuban hotels."
"13633","There are no positive comments to say about this hotel, all nh hotels just rip your money apart, the invoice say pay 416€ at the hotel and ended up paying 490 € because of the city tax and the 50 € deposit you have to make which is not specified in the description for the hotel. Not worth your money"
"13634","Really pleasant welcome and very friendly staff. Perfect for what we needed everything very clean and breakfast was excellent. Never seen my daughter eat that much in one sitting. All very good and will use for business in future."
"13635","Beautiful beach , nice pool and bar , very good food . Large Room with seaview  and modern bathroom all recently refurbished.  Beach restaurant on the beach very nive and excellent food"
"13636"," Very disppointing italian restaurant, decorated like an Ibis hotel,empty most the time . Very slow and non professional service.  The Indigo restaurant has very good food but looks like a canteen.  "
"13637","This was a most memorable stay for all the best reasons. The hotel is stylish and exceedingly well run. The staff without exception were friendly, helpful and professional. We can certainly recommend it without hesitation."
"13638","The area in which the hotel is situated can be rather daunting at night. However, the hotel can arrange taxis without any problem and it is very centrally situated for the Old Town of Montevideo."
"13639","The signs to the hotel are terrible in the dark.Our satnav could not find the hotel it lead us to about 3 Holiday inns on the same road?Our room was not quiet and it faced the main road .The carpark charges £12 is unfair for guests-although we found a nice space it is a pain to find a space at 8 pm ."
"13640","A friendly owner who does try to be helpful. The rooms were very clean.  Close to the bus station. (Be aware, the trike trip to the hotel should be only PHP 20, not PHP 50 as we were charged) "
"13641","We were expecting views, we were confronted with a cliff face.  Better value in the township area or for a little more you could stay right on the beachfront."
"13642","The staffs arr really helpful. The location of the hotel is strategic. Lots of thing to do here. Lots of food too."
"13643","The breadsheets are too old."
"13644","The position of the hotel is beautiful, the sad thing is this could be an amazing facility if the hotel had good management who ensured that the staff were trained.    The rooms on the whole were fine but the linen and pillows need to be upgraded, the idea of a blanket being used over and over again is not very nice.    The cleaning staff in the rooms were very pleasant as were the gentlemen who helped with the luggage, unfortunately this was not the same in the restaurant and on the front desk.    The Christmas Eve dinner was nice.    We love Mauritius having visited it many times, but we will certainly not be rushing back to the Indian Hotel and Spa."
"13645","The staff at reception were not welcoming at all, we waited for 45min before being given our room.    The staff in the restaurant were very unhelpful, and dismissive. There was a distinct lack of management around, so the service was very very poor.     The food was poor, the only meal that was good was the Christmas Eve dinner.    I think that the Mauritius travel board who gives hotels their rating needs to re asses this hotel as it is NOT a 4 star hotel and should not be marketed as one. If it were marketed as a 2 star hotel then people would go there with no expectations.     "
"13646","The hotel location, staff collaboration was very good. value for money. Will be visiting back again for sure."
"13647","English not so good for communication "
"13648","Very close to bus terminal.  Great beach.  Close to public transit to the 5 star strip.  Ideal for backpackers or people that want to go to various other places in Cuba."
"13649","Staff were super friendly and helpful"
"13650","friendly and helpful workers. lnternet connection in the rooms is good"
"13651","Staff and facilities were very good."
"13652","The room seemed to be fitted for a single traveller -e.g only one dressing gown, This was a slight disappointment"
"13653","Good customer service and location.  Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.  Enjoyed our stay very much"
"13654","Great staff...polite and helpful  Lovely room, large and spacious  Best bed and crispest sheets  Free transfers into the City  Great breakfast  "
"13655","Kindly assist in these matter as i have paid twice in these hotel , "
"13656","They said they cant find me on the computer and i have paid .   my number is south African . 0835919875    Adam Ngoasheng "
"13657","Good deal.(under the half price of what the other 5 star hotels in Belek offer.) The  place is clean"
"13658","Light sleepers, beware! There are two mosques in close vicinity. Their loudspeakers are excellent, so the call to prayer before sunrise will certainly wake you up. If your room faces Abdali Square chances are that nightly activity will keep you awake when the flee market is being set up (happens Thursday or Friday night, depending on the time of year I expect).    And for those who would like a drink: they don't serve alcohol. There are plenty of hotels in Amman, which do."
"13659","Located very near to the Tri-Rail/Amtrak and I-95. There is a Walgreens a block away. Nice TV with HD channels. Comfy beds. Right next to the city of Boca Raton."
"13660","Besides the desk, staff was not very friendly and barely spoke english. Elevator is old, slow and very hot because the a/c is broken (I really hate that elevator). There is working WiFi but at dial up speeds.... very slow. They never changed towels, just folded them nicely (although they clearly needed change). It is located very close to Boca Raton... but it clearly isn't Boca... not very decent people around at night."
"13661","Our family stayed on 26 and 27 December 2013.   We were very impressed with all the hotel facilities and especially the staff, who were very helpful.  It seemed tone a very happy working environment and we were very taken by the helpful, positive and friendly attitude of the staff.  I recommend it most strongly."
"13662","Good location, close to shops, restaurants and beach."
"13663","Shown to my room by an older gentlemen and a child (young girl about 8 year old).     Hotel rooms need to be maintained, carpet in  the bedroom is dated, wallpaper coming off the walls, room was not cleaned before my arrival. A lot of furniture for a small room  On arrival the shower was dirty, no toilet roll or  waste paper bin in the bathroom and TV did not work.Staff were notified and this was resolved within minutes- very good!! ( 2 teenage girls came to my room , only one cleaned the other just came with her and did nothing ).     Unfortunately my room phone would not accept incoming calls and I informed reception , this was fixed, then the following day  again when I had friends trying to call, they were informed I was unavailable when I was actually in the room , but the phone did not work.. I informed staff it was not working again ,I  was told they would fix it..they never fixed my phone. I was woken out of bed one night by a knock at my door , informing me  to come to reception for a phone call!! I would not go to reception. I think this is unacceptable-they should have fixed  my phone!!. On my 3rd day ,I did have to ask to have my room cleaned, more toilet roll, clean towels  and for my bin to be emptied, and this was done -which I was happy about.  Overall a nice hotel staff are OK, I guess you get what you pay for , so it was a pleasant stay at New York Hotel Lara, but unlikely I would return."
"13664","The pool was very disappointing since it is tiny and can only accommodate a fraction of the guests. Actually quite ridiculous and really needs attention since you cannot frequent any other pools if you are not a resident of that hotel, leaving little option but to live without a pool in the middle of summer!!"
"13665","Nice appearance and location"
"13666","The hotel is in bad state of maintenance!, the pool is very cold and the water not clean, loose tiles on the floor.  Breakfast is bad! Fitness extra costs(no dumbells etc).  Advice to book only logies..."
"13667","Nothing negative to report"
"13668","Very nice hotel and staff!!"
"13669","Nice hotel for the Price. Close to Shopping mall and High Way. "

"13671","Good location, Friendly staff"
"13672","great location and very quiet for city centre hotel. Nice evening meal and lovely breakfast. Staff polite and helpful."
"13673",".The only small negative is the room was a little bit on the cool side even with the thermostat full up at 28c."
"13674","We booked in August a total of four rooms in this hotel. However, we had looked at the location wrong and I tried to cancel the booking, understandably, it did not fit. Hotelopian I talked to the clerk and they agreed that the rooms are available to paid weeks. Otherwise, they would have been able to recover 90% of the money if you do not already have charged your card to my room. I do not understand why they had charged the money because the website clearly says that ""only pay the hotel."" We decided to book a hotel in Barcelona city center for three days and then go to the Costa Brava, hotel maria del Mare. I called on Tuesday and inquired about them but the rooms were no longer!? So, we paid about 1600 € for nothing .. Hotelopia is not responsible for inquiries how did this happen! And the review in the link was getting really difficult!  IF YOU WANT TO get rid of your money, BOOK THIS HOTEL!"
"13675","some staff were welcoming"
"13676","some of the staff were efficient ,patient and courteous"
"13677","I booked the room through hotelpedia but was told initially that my booking was not in the hotel's computer/database , only upon checking with the former were  we confirmed and checked into our room. we have to endured a long wait  after a long journey, not a very ideal  to start our trip. Also on the second night , we told the reception that our room cannot be open (due to the metal hinge ,not the smart card ). we request the lady in attendance to asked maintenance to rectify it as we were going out for dinner,3 hours later the problem wasn't solved and we asked the reception/maintenance all over again . Apparently the lady forgot our request, again tired and frustrated ."

Spa - staff very friendly and helpful whilst being professional.  Great facility.  Staff are eager to please (see my comment regarding fresh fruit below)"
"13695","A hotel of this class/price should have fresh fruit provided daily to each room, not just to the rooms of returning guests! (Though when I queried this fruit appeared within minutes.)"

"13698","We stayed in Junior Suite, a very nice, large room, which was excellent value for money.  The decor was minimilist, very clean and simple.  Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice, including Cava which I've come to expect in good 5* hotels.  Could be improved if freshly cooked eggs were offered, but I suspect they'd have obliged if I'd asked.  Staff were efficient, professional and very helpful."
"13699","The spa circuit should be free to hotel guests (Gym and outdoor pool were free, but the spa circuit, i.e. sauna/steam rooms/etc., were not)."

Room service was a bit inconsistent.had to ask for the sheets to be changed after 7days into our stay.Often the room was not made up until late afternoon /evening. Not really good enough for a four star hotel. However, we are always aware of being Eco friendly particularly with towels and did not expect them to be changed daily."

The whole resort was too big and could have been anywhere in the world, but I guess that might be true of all such resorts. Meals were served to hundreds of people at a time in the large dining area and sometimes it was necessary to queue. The food in the fake 'Italian' restaurant was like school dinners. Music in the pool area was too early and too loud for my personal liking and other guests seemed to feel the same. Good value if you stuff yourself and get very drunk but otherwise expensive. "

"13849","The hotel is about 6 years old but the decor is circa 1970's, beige, brown and cream all over with dated looking fittings.

There was nasty cheap child sized  plastic furniture on the balcony,  not good enough for a 5* hotel.   The mini bar in the room was a joke, an old fridge which was warm and contained 3 bottles of still water, 2 bottles of fizzy water and 2 cartons of fruit juice, no beer, pop, crisps or nuts.   Again not 5* standard.    The food was well cooked but there was an abundance of chicken and turkey cooked in various disguises, OK if you like these meats, personally I don't.   The gala dinner on New Years Eve was inedible, and judging by the amounts left on plates many people thought the same.       All drinks are local even though it does say on the hotel web site that there are some imported drinks available, whether this is just for the summer season I don't know.  But I would expect it to be the same all year round.    The choice of cocktails is very limited.

Located on the northern part of the island (Station 1), you are only a few steps away from the best beachfront in all of Boracay.  Their rooms are simple, yet functional and clean.  In terms of value for money, they are not as pricey as some of the bigger resorts or hotels in Station 1, though it can be quite expensive especially around the Super Peak season.  Their restaurant (Bar Lo) offers excellent food, and their happy hour which starts as early as 1pm is simply awesome for those who want to start partying early (try their mojito).  They have a fairly good-sized pool (though never swam), and the airport transfers though a bit expensive was on time and organized despite the busy season in and around the ports.  "

Their restaurant (Bar Lo) offers excellent food, and their happy hour which starts as early as 1pm is simply awesome for those who want to start partying early (try their mojito).  They have a fairly good-sized pool (though never swam), and the airport transfers though a bit expensive was on time and organized despite the busy season in and around the ports.  "
"13997","Being a very busy time (around New Year's), the staff appeared at times overwhelmed by the crowd.  There were a few instances that they forget our order, and we had to follow up a few times.  Maybe they need to staff up during the Holidays?  But no big deal, as the staff is very friendly and they try their best. "

"14000","Very friendly and helpful staff, even saved us some money on their own initiative. Actually closer to the beach than many large hotels that claim to be directly on the beach. Also wery easy to vary the ""all inclusive"" with other places and restauraants, since it is in the villige of Varadero"
"14001","Generally try to stay close to native Cuban food, it is a tropical country so the cooking of meat is not always what one is used to. If you got favorite spices, bring them with, the food is rather blend, at least to a Swede.     Although it has nothing to do with the hotel itself, stick to the yellow state taxis until you know what the cost should be. It also saves on the enviroment. And, if you are booking yourself from Europe, stay away from London and Canadian Air, especially in combination. It did cost us to days in airports, instead of on the beach!"

The shower is not good either, not hand shower is it, but a giant shower up on so you get completely drenched. Halt on the floor, it is also, no wash bowl in the cabin either so you have to put soap on the floor.  The room is cheaper if you book it via Hotelopia.

The hotel is simple but served us very well, the size of the room was great, larger than the golden sands where we normally stay. The beach is clean and not so busy, again better than the stretch of beach at the golden sands.

"14506","We arrived late at night after a long flight to be told our room had no electric or hot water . We then had to move to another hotel across the road. I honestly think they had overbooked  and had an arrangement with the central park hotel.  We returned in the morning and no room was available . We returned at lunchtime with our cases and still no room . We returned an hour later and with the lift out of working order had to carry our cases up six flights of stairs. There was no sign of help from the porters. We were only in Havana three days and by this time had lost half a day. The lift did not work then every time we wanted to go to our room had to climb the stairs tome and again and when you get to the bottom and find you have forgotten your camera is not fun.  The hotel did not have WiFi there was no sign of our paid for complementary drink and we went in the bar and the barman gave me the dregs of a bottle of red wine and when I said it was terrible he just took it away and went back to the kitchen.  I would never stay there the central park hotel is far superior."

Taste was ok. All inclusive but do not have high expectation.  - Had to wear a bright orange wristband for them to identify hotel guests from the moment of check-in until check-out. There is no way of taking it off. I was forced to wear it for 7 days even when I was showering, sleeping, sunbathing, eating out and clubbing.

Then the man said ""sorry"" and left.I thought he would go back to his office and checked it all out and that would be the end of it. But, no, when he got back to his office, he phoned me up in the middle of the night to ask me what was my full name and i felt like I was being Interrogated.I gave him my full name and told him I'm very tired and sleepy and I'm only due to check out on Friday. If there's any errors it must have been made by their hotel staff so checked with them. After that I couldn't get any peace of mind for my remaining holidays.

I don't know why they cannot approach the guest during the afternoon or evening If the check out time is at 12 noon.Instead they choose to force themselves into the guest room while the guest is asleep.There must be some kind of rights for the paying guest.

"14584","Just came back from a week long stay at Liki Tiki. Overall had a great stay.    The staff were all pleasant, helpful and very nice when you needed help. We declined partaking in the timeshare pitch and were not pressured at all.     The resort itself was nicely kept. Lots of activities for the little ones. We played mini-golf, rode the paddle boats, the surrey bike etc. Went to the movie night for the kids one of the evenings. There were activities every day that we could do on the days we weren't in the parks.    It was a little on the cooler side the week we were there so we didn't use the water park (it is indeed not heated and quite chilly) so the few days that we went swimming we used one of the heated pools and it was quite nice.    Location wise, it's about 10-15 min drive to Disney and 20-25 min to Universal. I would only recommend staying here if you have a car rented for your vacation as not much within walking distance, but there is everything you could need along the 192 in minutes with a car (restaurants, grocery stores, Target Super Store etc.)    Overall it was perfect for the price we paid.     I'd definitely stay here again."

We were instead put in the 1200 building in the back of the resort.

If you're expecting a 5 Star resort with immaculate rooms you won't get that. But you're not paying 5 Star Resort prices. On the flip side you're getting more than you're typical hotel by having separate rooms, full kitchen etc.   "

We asked to change it, and we got a very nice, spacious room with a french balcony towards the Prado.  Evidently, they've got bad rooms and good rooms for the same price. So take the advice if you're not satisfied with the room, change it! They might say the hotel is fully booked, but just keep on complaining and you'll get a nicer room.  Maintenance is rather poor all over, so be prepared of disfunctioning (and flowing) WC:s, showers, hair dryers etc. The janitor will try to solve the problem, but only temporarily."

The stiff, awkward service in reception and the restaurant did not help and it felt like the place was always trying to up sell. The menu did not help as it excluded tax which was added when the bill arrived.    We had lunch, dinner and breakfast and all the food was fairly good which was a bonus.    The room is quaint and rustic, comfortable enough though for a nights stay.    The hotel arranged a guide for the ruins which cost about £37 for the two of us plus the £9 entrance fee each and it was far better than just wondering about wondering on our own, it did bring it alive.    The hotel is fine for a stop off but does need to update the service to a more relaxed style and possible update the room interiors."

"14801","Bad service...Not a hotel for those with walking problems as transport buggies do not come as regularly as they should and do not transport to rooms. The complex is very large. We had a triple room that was booked months before our stay. We were booked at this hotel on two separate occasions - on neither occasion was the third bed made up despite the manager clearly saying that they were. On our second stay the sofa bed collapsed and was propped up with a coffee table underneath. Certainly not a 5 hotel. The food in the general dining room was buffet which was cheap quality. I would NOT recommend anyone to stay at this hotel."

They were around £40 a bottle they did have cheaper bottles on the menu but they didn't ever to be available.  So most people ordered bottles of water in the restaurant which was a shame.    The other negative point was the free wi- fi system which did work once you could get into the system and put the password in which you had to do every 24 hours which was a bit of a pain but I understand that the hotel is looking into addressing this."
"14942","This is a wonderful hotel in a wonderful location. The food staff and service were excellent. We had a sea view room on the top (3rd floor no lifts in this hotel) with a balcony which was wonderful to sit out on in the evenings watching the sunset over the ocean.  We actually got married here and the staff made the wedding and our honeymoon fantastic.

"14946","Got a brilliant deal through Hotelopia for a double room and then an even better one at the hotel itself when we upgraded to the Presidential Room. Staff were very friendly and helpful and both rooms were well appointed - the Presidential is a beautiful room, huge bed with curving walls and a massive bath and walk in shower, lovely views over the park, definitely worth paying a little extra for. The hotel itself has lovely lighting at night with different coloured lights down the walls and the trees lit up with fairy lights - quite magical. "

"14962","The hotel is stated as 4 stars hotel, but I would give max 2,5 stars. The resort is old, needs a lot repair works. The elevator was never working, during our 2 weeks stay we could use elevator only twice! Shower water was never stable, either it was too hot or too cold. Showering was really bad experience. Dining area was quite unpleasant, as there was seen mold on the walls. Food quality was fair, nothing special. The coffee was good only in lobby bar, in dining area only instant coffee was offered. So-called a la carte restaurants didn´t deserve a la carte name, as the food and service were so poor. Reception was sometimes very unprofessional, we had to wait 4 hours, as they couldn´t find our booking! When they did, no appologies were heard. So, I´m probably not going to stay in Palma Real again, as it certainly is not worth the money."

"14990","Excellent value so near to the centre of KL    We were very impressed when we arrived, very smart and professional reception. The room was average size and contained everything that we needed for a few days stay in KualaLumpur. It was very clean and well maintained, the maid ""made up"" the room each day with clean towels and sheets. The inclusive breakfast was good - fruit juice, fresh fruit, eggs, sausage,beans, scotch pancakes, toast, jam, tea and coffee. There was also a selection of Malaysian dishes. Free WiFi was available in the room. Easy to walk to KLSentral, the hub for the various train lines. Cheap and frequent trains to all the popular tourist sites within 10 mins.  The only downside is the area of ""Brickfields"" around the hotel is a little untidy and run down. However we wandered around at night, walking to the local restaurants and never felt uneasy or threatened. The local people were friendly and helpful. In a more salubrious area the hotel would command much higher rates. We would certainly stay again.    If your arrival point in the city is KL Sentral, follow these walking directions to the hotel:  Take the left hand exit which is next to the KLIA ticket office. Then turn right following sign to Brickfields and Monorail. Take the down escalator on your left and at the bottom do a 'u' turn and walk along in the same direction as the traffic. Follow the pavement around to the right to a cross roads, you should now see the hotel ahead, Summer View Hotel in large letters at the top. Cross straight across this road and keep walking past YMCA. The hotel is on your left. It is less than 10 minutes walk from KL Sentral"

Buses outside the hotel took you right to the doorstep of Plaza Mayor, if you chose not to use the Metro. And any tourist  65 and over can purchase a concession card (with proof of age- Passport)and travel on trains in Spain very cheaply. There is also a Tourist Information Van parked in the plaza adjacent to Sofia Reina (and literally 'next door' to the hotel), staffed by young English-speaking Spaniards, who are extremely helpful in providing maps and information about what's happening in Madrid, at the time of your visit. Hotel staff were also courteous and helpful. This is my second stay at the Hotel ( I was there for a week in May in 2012) and I would highly recommend it, for all the above reasons and its excellent value for money, compared to other major hotels in the area.

The place is disorganised, the staff unprofessional, the waiters are unable to take breakfast orders and the food when it arrives is unappealing.

The room was quite small and even though i had booked a room for 2 people, i was only provided with 1 towel ! the bedroom had chewing gum on the floor and the bathroom was filthy, getting the room was a challenge. The safety box was also broken, the staff simply shrugged off these complaints. The omelette for breakfast was greasy and the coffee simply tasteless brown water.   Avoid this hotel at all costs, there are better options. "

The staff were very friendly and helpful and Mr. Garfield the concierge could not do enough for us during our stay. The room was spacious by New York standards and very clean and comfy. We grabbed dinner and a few drinks in the wheeltapper bar next door and could not fault it, great atmosphere in the bar at night. The rooms are very good value for the price and will definitely be staying there again."

Hotelopia charged me £63.64?? Am very angry and won't be using hotelopia again unless I get refunded.    One lady in particular on reception was very rude.   Your staff at the hotel and staff over the phone working on your reservations line need to know your checking in / out times because I was told 3 different times.  When I got to the hotel I was turned away as we couldn't  heck in when we arrived. "

"15259","Since its been taken over by Hilton from Waldorf Astoria the standards have gone down, the standards of the pool area could have been renewed and freshened up, I was looking forward to staying here as I did last year and Im disappointed as this is a 5* rated hotel and it was when Waldorf Astoria had owned it but now very disappointed as standards of luxury have slightly gone down. Down to the smallest details as the glasses in the rooms were gorgeous last year but this year they are like something you would find in a Holiday Inn. If you have stayed in this hotel before when it was part of the Waldorf Astoria chain and are going back I wouldnt expect the same standards as before and if you would be going here for the 1st time it may be different as it is still a lovely hotel. The breakfast you get is also quite bland and boring, you will get your usual few bits but nothing special so I would recommend making sure you have planned lunch. It gives you the info of there being a games room but when we have stayed there it has always been closed. There are also lights around the glass shields on balconies and some which are not working properly and flashing which looks like a motel out of an american movie. "

Added bonus was to have a fridge and good sized flat screen tv.  Sauna, Hammam and indoor pools were lovely with sea views from the windows.  All in all a very nice hotel, and very good value for money in the winter months.  Maybe not what we would class as 5* but definitely a good 4*"

A bus stop is just outside and a free bus links dock and railway station, going past the art gallery and seacity museum."
"15289","With more investment in the interior design and upkeep this could easily be the 4* hotel it claims to be. As it is, in a standard room, the tiles in the bathroom and the woodwork around the windows are showing mould, and the corridors all show chips, scuffs and marks in the relentless mushroom grey paint which may nod to history but makes the public areas of the hotel seem rather dingey. However, the walls display a nice arrray of photos of Southampton, and the Jane Austen suite where she celebrated her 18th birthday, now bookable for conference or wedding reception is attractively papered in pale blue regency stripe."

On the Monday morning when I checked out housekeeping came up to see me to let me know that NO items had been handed in from the room. The person who serviced the room on the Saturday was not at work that day so the housekeeping manager took details of the items lost and my mobile number and said that he would ring me back the following day (Tuesday) when he had investigated. It is now Thursday and no call. Therefore, it became a very expensive weekend as I had to purchase a new suitcase, pair of jeans, socks, underwear and small clothing items! My fault I know for not checking the wardrobe before I left but as housekeeping are meant to keep any items found in rooms in lost property I dont know how such large items could have gone unnoticed. Also am disappointed that the housekeeping manger who was so lovely and helpful to my face did not call me as promised even if it was to say they items had not been located.

"15384","This hotel does what it does very well indeed! I could not fault rooms, service, cleanliness, facilities. The food is not 'fine dining', but is fresh, varied and plentiful and always available, and who can argue with a 7 course Brazillian meat banquet for no extra charge! The Spa facilities were delightful, a chill out 'cave' and steam room, again included in the 'all inclusive package' with only treatments  as an extra cost ( and quite reasonable). The 11pm finsh for all inc. meant everyone went to bed, so a lovely peaceful night. All in all an excellent choice for a short break. We would definitely go back, excellent value for money. Very impressed! Brilliant facilities for children up to young teens, tots water slides and indoor soft play with their own Jungle themed restaurant."

There is plenty of room to get away from them. Dont let it stop you visiting.  The evening entertainment is very old fashioned cabaret ( as is often the case in hotels). But you don't have to watch!   "

"15388","There is nothing good to say about this hotel. I don't even know where to begin in describing how awful this place is. The rooms are described as beach huts, they are not. They are corrugated tin sheds that are not sealed. You will be given a padlock to lock it, which will show when you are out and could easily be broken into. In the description it says ""air conditioned rooms"" we had a fan, that didn't work. The toilet is just attached to the back of your room (shed) and it has lizards and Mosquitos everywhere. Don't bother trying to flush the toilet as it will just shoot straight back out at you. This was one of the more expensive hotels we booked on our travels and it is the worst place I have ever been in. I would have probably been safer sleeping on the beach. I'm not over exaggerating I've backpacked to a lot of places and never have I seen anything as bad as this place. Stay well away, "

"15527","This was a private charter for Sochi 2014. The price was a little on the high side for B & B but offset by the professionalism of Norwegian Cruise Lines.

"15675","Check in lines were long. Half of the elevators were not working. We stayed in Claridge tower. We were told not to worry about the elevators since this part of the hotel would no longer be managed by Ballys in a week. That did not help us since we still had to use them during our stay. Several people waited so long they walked up 18 flights.. Hallways and carpeting in hallways were dirty. The rooms were clean in comparison but very old. Bathroom had mold on shower curtain and water did not drain quickly out of the shower."

Need to have a total paint job. In the bathroom new showercurtains, and a new shower head. The apartment was missing a few items that I would say necessary for a rent out, one is a automatic coffe machine and the other is a toaster. Hope this will help to inprove, Because the Gemelos 2 is my favorit place to stay in Benidorm. ( We did let the agent know a bout this ,when returning the key)"

"15688","This is a very good quality hotel in what was part of County Hall and apart from mistaking it for its even better quality sister around the corner, was excellent.  Our group had a studio with a little area with another TV, settee and kitchen and another double room which also had a microwave, tea making and crockery.  With a convenience store just around the corner towards Big Ben, this could make a good base.  The rooms on the 13th floor were quiet, clean and modern with a choice of pillows. The TV had a fair range of channels including Sky Sports.    Will be going back next time we are in London as the little extra cost for this hotel was well worth it for location and quality.  "

These are away from the main Hotel complex.  The rooms are clean and comfortable. The furniture is old fashioned and  you have to stand in the bath to use the shower. We have not stayed in the new modern rooms as we like the character of the  garden rooms. The breakfasts are excellent with plenty of choice. The heated pool in the gardens is nice, if small with views out over the sea, harbour  and town. Residents have access to the larger pool in the hotels sister establishment. This is accessed by a lift. The lift also takes a lot of effort out of walking back from Funchal town of an evening, otherwise you would have to tackle a steep hill. The place has a genteel but classy   feel. The staff are excellent. If you don't want to use the hotel restaurant there are several excellent restaurants just  minutes away. We have enjoyed our stays and will use this hotel again. we did our first Levada walk and hope to do more."

I have to say that it was a bit of a challenge to find the rooms at first... The rooms that we got were almost excellent with everything in order and large in size but what I have to highlight the most is the amazing staff that work at the resort. We had the pleasure of meeting Arais (Buffet Waitress) who was amazing at all times. I have to mention as well the waiters at the snack bar Mario, Yosvani, etc which were again excellent.    We had every night a show which was very entertaining and we got to meet some of the dancers who again were very friendly and informative, unfortunately I cant remember all the names but to name a few Jorge, Keylan, Claudia, Diana and some more whose names I cant remember.    Overall this made our trip a 10 out of 10 and Im already saving money to go back to Tryp Cayo Coco ;)"

She was so abrupt and very quick to want to get rid of us. We were give a room on the fourth to realise to our horror it was a smoking room and my husband is asthmatic, at no point were we offered whether we would require a smoking or non smoking room. This woman clearly needs some back to basics on customer care. "

"15836","This was not an hotel, but a B&B. It's situated in a street that hardly anyone knows in Rome, even the taxidriver had to look several times if the adress was correct. And because the confirmationpaper I received after the booking, only mentioned the name of the street and not the number, we couldn't find it. In the street there was no sign of the B&B, and at none of the more than 50 appartments,  we could see the name. So eventually, after three searching, and a huge taxibill, we haven taken another hotel."

We said not a problem and we would spend the 2 nights in the Victoria. I had said it was our anniversary so it was lovely to find a bottle of Cava, chocolate and rose petals over the bed. As compensation they gave us free parking, wine with our meal and lunch on the day we arrived. We had a lovely sea view so was lovely to sit in sun and read our books for a while. The hotel is great for the old town of Benidorm as it only takes a couple of minuets to walk and it's lovely for a stroll along the prom. Food was great and lots to choose from. Next year we will try again for the Royal but would be happy to stay in the Victoria again."

My room was on the 17th floor and had quite a view over the city. Everything about the room was great, air conditioning, free wifi, quiet, tastefully furnished and most comfortable, spotlessly clean too!  The bathroom had only a shower which for me was fine. The mirror was not of the 'heated, steam free' type which surprised me, as so much thought had gone into everything else for the comfort of guests. That would be my only negative point, although it is a personal preference!  Breakfast was tasty with plenty on offer to suit all tastes. All in all a short but enjoyable stay, if i found myself in Birmingham again, I would most definately return here."

"16066","Upon entering the room saw a tray of goodies from truffles, chips etc, then noticed a black box picked it up to figure out what it was on closer inspection and it was an intamcy kit. We laughed about it at first and set it back down (unopened) on the tray, although if i had children with me and they picked it up wouldve been very inappropriate. so that was a problem for me, but it wasnt until later another guest informed us that should you pick up any items on the tray after 20 seconds it has sensors that detect its removal and youll be billed automatically on your credit card. I was extremely annoyed, because there was no sign in front of tray to make guests aware of this. Luckily i called and they took the charges off but the fact of having to deal with this was a pain and made me angry esp when your here to have fun. Apparently at check in theyre supposed to inform you of this but didnt. Ive stayed in many hotels in Vegas and not once had this sensor tray. maybe its catching on in a few now, but i didnt like it so i will stay somewhere else cause the Venetian i think is taking liberties, most guess do auto check out and wont realize until they get home and check theyre billing statements and find charges for items not used. However this was my only issue, other than that a great hotel but passing on this info to others if planning a first time stay here."

The distance to Tengah beach is about 1km. Cenang beach is a little farther than that. You can walk to the beach or take a cab, which will cost you 10RM.

The distance to Tengah beach is about 1km. Cenang beach is a little farther than that. You can walk to the beach or take a cab, which will cost you 10RM. Sunba, the famous club is also a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel, which I believe is quite walkable."
"16180","Across the road from the beach & restaurants, good buffet breakfast included. Close to the airport, 200 THB each way for the airport transfer. A good place to stay for a night, particularly if you have an early/late flight. The room was very clean (minor maintenance required in bathroom) the mattress is firm (might not suit everyone). Free Wifi in the foyer area and friendly staff."

Please note that there are some ground floor rooms available which ( if necessary through mobility problems) need requesting for, as otherwise there are stairs,-- no lift.

The breakfast was excellent, varied choices including a Cypriot table. fresh eggs cooked in various ways on demand with a very pleasant cook.    A spotless hotel with fresh towels daily and bedding changed twice in a 5 day stay.    There was a shop on site which had home baked bread, and a friendly owner who spoke good English.    In fact all of the staff spoke fluent English.    We stayed B & B and ate out every night but there was a full kitchen in the apartment and a supermarket directly opposite which sold everything you needed.

We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms, and as such it was pretty, but a little dark - it was facing a little shaded yard, and mosquitoes were all over the terasse, so we didn't use that at all.

We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms, and as such it was pretty, but a little dark - it was facing a little shaded yard, and mosquitoes were all over the terasse, so we didn't use that at all.

It was like a prison cell where the toilets are in the cell. I don't want to watch anyone on the loo or if I am sharing with anyone watch them shower. Talking of showers on the last day I used my sister inlaws shower and it flooded everywhere. I would say book it if the price is right for you and you are a couple but as friends sharing a twin - no way."

One hot shower and you couldn't see in the mirror for ages!

Staff did offer to come and have a look and they may have fixed it, but it was our last night so we left it and opened the window instead, which was fine. Restaurant for breakfast was good, but staff did leave plates piled on the table and weren't too attentive at clearing."

"16501","So many bad things to say about this hotel however, we felt that nothing much had been done about it cos the reviews had shown and no changes were made.  The so called senior front office manager was so rude!!  The flush didnt work properly.  We requested for king sized room but didnt give to us at all instead gave to Caucasian man that came later than us and got no reservation.  The breakfast was so lousy that we didnt even want to waste out time sitting there. Only went for 1 day breakfast."

"16508","The absolute best thing about this hotel, and the main reason we keep returning to it, has got to be its fabulous location! It is exactly where we want to be both during the day and of an evening. Out the front of the hotel you step straight on to the centre of Av. Las Americas (the 'golden mile'), and out the back beyond the huge pool area is the lovely Camison beach area with a lovely walk which takes you all the way through to Los Christianos.  We also really like the pool towel service which enables you to get a nice clean and dry towel each day and also helps free up some much needed suitcase space!"
"16509","The hotel interior (from bedrooms to bathrooms to public spaces) needs a complete overhaul.  There is no way the bedrooms are of the size or quality expected of a 4 or 5 star hotel-they are a 3 star at best. They are compketely dated with old fashioned, bordering on useless, facilities such as tv and hairdryer. I also don't agree with having to pay to hire the fridge in your bedroom-again, surely not a sign of a 4/5* hotel?! There has obviously been no upgrade to the bedrooms since the hotel was built 25 years ago and it is such a shame as they really are a disappointment. The hotel seems to be reliant on their fabulous location being enough to satisfy guests, and up to a point it does-afterall, we go there around 4 times a year! But to really be of at least a 4 star standard they need to refurbish the bedrooms and bathrooms as the entire place looks dated and tired.  All of that said, however, I will still be returning due to the fab location of the hotel!"

The second problem is unacceptable.  Repair services should be immediately available when the problem arises.  Internet nowadays is an indispensable feature.  It has to be reliable.

I won't stay again unless the hotel address this issue and make a night time smoking area"

"16681","This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.  There were very very few people at this hotel--maybe 5 or 6 cars at most.  They demanded a $25 cash deposit for possible damage to the room which I could get back in the morning.  Why was this necessary with such few people. I am 78 years old and I did not have a dog.  I did not feel safe.  I did not feel that anything was clean.  I stayed for 5 hours after I returned from dinner.  I left before 4:00 AM because the bed was terrible and I could not rest at all.  The hotel is hidden behind a gas station next to on-going construction.  Although I had mentioned my handicap (I use a cane) they still wanted to put me some distance from my car.  I insisted they had to have something closer by because I could not carry anything that far.  A totally BAD experience!!!!!!!!!! "

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and they are all so courteous and friendly. Our room was beautifully decorated and the sea view we had was simply stunning. I would definitely recommend anyone staying here to upgrade to gold level as the benefits received more than make up for the extra cost (private check in, afternoon tea, cocktail hour with canapes, etc). The beach and pool areas are amazing. Frevo (brazilian) & Ba (chinese) restaurants were our favourites. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of going to Dubai."

"16815","Though the room was cheaper the other 4and 5* hotels it was purely that the room was in the oldest part of the building which was built in the 70's under the Hilton name. The a/c had 2 settings, on, which was freezing and off. The room needed a refurb. The television picture was dark unless you had the lights on. The bathroom was dingy and a lack of towels. Overall I would not reccommend staying in the older garden wing to anyone expecting 4*+ accommodation"

Great breakfast but after 11 nights the food starts to taste the same.  Very attentive staff.  Talked to one of the managers and the hotel is going to get a big renovation in the future which will make it even better.  Very satisfied with out stay."

You can take the 35 bus from the airport and it lets you off right in front of the hotel.It was an 1 hr and a half bus ride but it gave us a chance to see the city and it only cost 1.50 vs an expensive cab ride.  Across the street is a mall, a movie theatre and a great hiking/jogging trail. The free breakfast was excellent. Much more than just cold cereal.

I simply asked for an appointment to review our car entering and leaving the car park without damage. As for the room, I guess if you like listening to your partner in the toilet as there is no privacy and your ok with your car bringing damaged, at what could be Australia's most expensive valet parking... Then yes this us a hotel for you. Personally we wont be back or refer it yo our friends and family... If only the duty manager on nights was maybe a little more capable of showing empathy and working through issues, this review would never be necessary. The staff professionalism typically Australian 4 star so if you want to be treated like every guest is a priority and personal conversations can wait until after work then maybe pay extra and stay elsewhere."

Reception staff were helpful and efficient.  From the hotel it is about a 10 - 15 minute walk into the lovely Old Town, not difficult and there are plenty of trams. But just over the road from the hotel you are into the old Jewish Quarter where there are many very cheap, interesting bars and restaurants serving very good food and drink. It is also an interesting area just to wander around - full of narrow streets and quiet corners and well worth a day's exploration."

The dining room is fantastic - great breakfasts and extremely well run. The manager of the dining room was particularly welcoming and efficient.In fact all the staff were excellent.

"17131","During our stay there the hotel had experienced a water leak and had to relocate half of the building which meant us.. And thats when we had the awesome adventure of trying to relocate to the new hotel. The front desk arranged the transfer via cab to the new hotel. When we got to the new hotel they booked our new room under the managers name after finding that out we weren't able to check in early without paying another fee.       Staff spoke just enough English to get you checked into a room and that's about it. I kind of expected that from reading previous reviews but having at lease someone who spoke a little more English would have been nice.    "

"17136","I found two hairs in my breakfast. I didn't complain as I was traveling with my partner and it was the last morning of our holidays before traveling home (to different countries), so I didn't say anything, but it was far from ideal. Also, they definitely weren't mine as my hair is blonde then hairs were thick and black. The bed room was small. The hotel isn't in walking distance of anything.....poor location. They provided transport to the airport (and other places) but their prices were very expensive. They charged 35JD to go to the airport, so we booked our own taxi, which cost 20JD and collected us from the hotel."

"17250","We spent one week in Hilton Allamanda with my wife in October, 2013. The best things about the hotel were:  - The staff was really very nice and helpful.  - The hotel room looked newly renovated with modern interior, and it had a convenient size balcony as well with breathtaking view on the ocean.  - The restaurant was also great, there was rich variety of choices for breakfast. Also for dinner it seemed to us to be a good option - the 'a la carte' menu is rather short, but whatever we tried was delicious and good value for the money (compared to few other restaurants except 'take aways').  - The area is very calm and quiet, there is hardly anyone on the beach.  - The gym is equipped with good quality cardio machines, like thread mill."

Eventually ordered 2 g/ t from a older gentleman, bill £28. Top tip, if there is something going on in the Liberal club next door, which is part of the hotel, go to ur room or go for a walk because every part of the hotel becomes a no-go area. Breakfast was good, however we were seated in an overflow room, my wife nearly passing out from the temperature of the room, ice room. We had breakfast in our room the next morning, £10 supplement .

"17466","I can't fault this hotel for the price range, there are more prestigeous hotels in Birmingham, but that is reflected in the price.  We regularly stay at this hotel, as it is value for money, central for amenities, meaning we can have a relaxing break without worrying about taxis.  Staff are very helpful, rooms are clean and secure."

The staff were very polite and accommodated our special requests for an iron and ironing board in our room, which was very handy.   The curtains in the room were fantastic! I had no idea what time of day it was when I woke up in the morning, the curtains kept the light out brilliantly! I want some at home. "
"17469","Although it was a double room (room 24), it was very small and the bed was in a corner. This meant that it could only be accessed on one side and the configuration of the room was such that the dressing table was immediately at the foot of the bed, so it made getting into and out of bed very difficult for me (who was stuck with the wall side of the bed).   The shower was VERY temperamental and rapidly increased in temperature until it was hot enough to cook you, but if you tried to alter the temp it went cold and you had to turn it off to reset it. Very annoying!  Generally there was a lot of noise in the hotel from guests going up and down stairs, and from the plumbing in the adjacent rooms. If staying again I would request a room away from the main thoroughfare."

"17496","Family of 5 travelling from UK. Booked 3 rooms at Hotel Duran as a stopover. Can only give high praise for this hotel which is easy to get to close to the motorway and has signs showing the way as soon as you hit the town. Park outside (reserved drop zone)  to drop your bags and then transfer your car 50 yards to a convenient & secure underground car park (spaces small & limited but we managed to get the people carrier in). Our rooms were spotless and of a very good standard beating expectations. The receptionist was lovely and spoke English to us. Breakfast was normal Spanish self serve set up with very nice selection of cheeses, cold meats/hams, fruits, cereals, bread & toastmaker etc., We did not eat dinner at the hotel as we arrived late & wanted to have a beer near the square and experience some local bars and pinchos (tapas). Duran menu looks lovely and would definitely have eaten here given another day. Would definitely do this again and stay here."

"17638","Although the hotel was reasonable value for money as in Central London, we weren't very happy with the food or the facilities - we paid for continental breakfast and I don't think I have ever had a poorer breakfast in a hotel.  It was difficult to find anything edible - only toast, cereal and cheap swiss rolls.  The facilities in the room and at the hotel weren't great either - no tea / coffee making facilities, no bar, nothing really.  This hotel is reasonable if you intend to spend very little time in it and only using it as a base but would be very depressing otherwise!"

"17649","Lack of info on what is actually included when you book. e.g. there's a BIG difference between All Inclusive and Full Board (Not only does Full Board exclude ALL drinks even the soft drinks at 2euros each can add up by the end of the week.. However, Full Board also excludes access to the indoor swimming pool/fitness facilities which you had to pay 10euro's per visit. With the outdoor pool being pretty cold due to the moderate Easter weather, the kids couldn't spend too much time in the out door pool.     Labelling of vegetarian / variety of food - was quite repetitive. Some members of our group were vegetarians & struggled as there were hardly any veggie options. A lot of items were incorrectly labelled as not containing meat which could have been quickly corrected by putting a green ""V"" against the labels.. Even the mixed salads contained meat/fish. With improvisation & friendly staff, everyone still had a great time & would visit again but would be wiser with our booking.."

Ok it may not have the very latest in high tec and amenities but it is clean and tidy although a little worn around the edges, but the service is excellent. Very good value if you want sunshine, a nice pool to sit around during the day and next door to the Abu Dhabi Mall where you can get all your shopping and food if you don't want hotel restaurants "

"17680","This hotel was much worse than I was expecting. Although relatively cheap in comparison to hotels in the uk for a similar price it is far below standard. The room was grotty, sheets and towels were clean but cushions on the bed were filthy. We had a family living outside the window so didn't really feel comfortable opening the curtains.   The most annoying thing is that it advertises a pool and the pictures show lovely rooms, but when we got there, the pool was empty and the room was nothing like the picture. We didn't sample any food so can't comment on that. Lobby bar is as pictured and very nice. Location is great and when we did look out the window we did have a sea view.   If you are looking for a budget hotel with no facilities in a good location then this hotel is fine, just be aware it is not how they advertise it. "

Steep steps to the front of the hotel may restrict older or disabled clientele- some sort of courtesy bus to the bus terminus would be useful. "

Poor attitude and a real lack of engagement. Not massively overwhelmed By the guys in the bar opposite either which is a real shame.   Wifi in the room is expensive and so is the water.  The 20 dollar deal may work if you have kids eating breakfast but was not a good deal for us. Especially as it has to apply to the whole of your stay even if you arrive late  and leave early as we did.   Finally and as I say I am being picky I know but I guess I am the one who is paying .... we had a room that connected to another. Great if you are traveling with family. Not so great if you are not, have had an early morning and a long flight and there is an excitable family of five next door still being excitable at midnight. Sound proofing or an adults only floor would be a real selling point!!"

Whilst geographically central, you will need a vehicle to get anywhere (including shops and restaurants etc). The need for a vehicle seems to be something that is common to a lot of the Phoenix.    The rooms are clean and well maintained. There is tea, coffee and paper cups provided in the room, however there are no milk/creamer, plates or cutlery. The front desk seems happy to oblige with any requests for these types of things.    The room service appears to be provided by a third party. It was a little expensive, but the food was tasty and portion sizes large. The hotel breakfast had a reasonable range of food selections. My partner enjoyed the pool and spa.

"18160","Room & hotel in general: Excellent! The room is clean and spacious. I had a pool-view room and the views were lovely! the garden is nice too and you can just sit and relax there. There's international dance performance in the evening on Tuesday and it's a great show.  Staff: The staff from the reception to the bar were all professional, helpful, and cheerful.  Food: The breakfast and dinner were great! There's a large varierty of food to choose from and the quality is good.   Location: It's not in a busy area and is quite 'remote'. But here is a bus stop outside of the hotel and the bus will take you to Protaras, Ayia Napa, etc, in 20-30 mins for EUR1.5 per way. There's also a restaurant outside and the food is good.  Sports: You can ask about the scuba diving tour at the reception or you can rent a bicycle for EUR10 per day. The pool is very pretty too.    I would recommend this hotel to my friends."

In my previous two hotels, their breakfast was very rich to include fried mushrooms, fried eggs, boiled eggs, scramble eggs, ham, fried bacon, bakings, baked beans, suasages, veg. etc.  You don't have to do even half as much because those hotels were more expensive and more stars than yours., but just provide the basic ingredients to go with bread. For some reasons, my room was not as warm as I would have wanted it to be. May be this was only a personal experiences and did not affect thoer people.

Hotel is joined to the Bellagio, so gives you great access to all the surrounding hotels/casinos/bars/restaurants etc. The Cosmopolitan is a short walk (less than 2mins) and has a fantastic selection of restaurants, shops and of course the casino. "
"18307","Lack of proper restaurant means you have to go elsewhere for a good meal, but with the selection on offer within 5mins walk its really not that big a problem at all. "
"18308","The restaurant had one price on the menu out the front and a different price inside. And the charge $10 for a bottle of water. Come on people! That's ridiculous."

As we didn't know Birmingham city centre, we decided to have a meal in the hotel before the concert. We asked for a menu at the bar, and we were surprised to find only 3 choices on the menu. These were 2 kinds of burger and chilli con carne, we opted for the latter, and sat alone in the dining room for the entire time we took for our meal, which wasn't particularly tasty. However when we left the hotel we understood the reason why the menu was so limited, there is a wealth of restaurants and bars on the doorstep. The other little gripe is not enough tea/coffee/milk facilities in the room."
"18444","We stayed here for just one night as we were attending an event at the nearby NIA, which is just 10 minutes walk away from the hotel. The staff were very friendly and the room was very clean and adequate for our needs. The room which was on the 6th floor was very quiet, and although being told that the hotel was full that night, we had a very quiet nights sleep with no disturbances inside or outside the hotel. The buffet style breakfast is of a very good standard, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Another plus point is that the bathroom has a great shower and all the toiletries you need provided."
"18445","The car parking is a bit vague, we missed the hotel car park as it wasn't obvious despite having a sat nav .We parked in a car park which was just next door, and was cheaper than the hotel car park.

Make sure if you want to be on the pool/beach side that you book the standard room.  Every night the hotel had activities/dancers/shows that started at 9:30pm and the music was so loud that we could feel it vibrating through our room. If like to sleep before 10:30/11pm or have young children that are in bed before then then you will have a lot of trouble sleeping."

The hotel is situated in the 4th floor of an old building without any lift or elevator provided for guests (There is a lift, but for private use of Mr. owner!). A disgusting smell of sour air is all over the stairs and corridors. The bed in the room was broken and it made a horrible noise by a tiny movement. I could not sleep properly on that bed for two nights during my stay in the Hell Suvenir! Actually, I am very upset about Hotelpedia. I trusted you and then I found my vocation ruined! I feel so used. From now, I will never trust you again. "

"19138","Beautiful hotel. The staff just can't do enough for you, they are so courteous and helpful. The pool area is lovely and you get a nice sea view, with Atlantis in the background. The breakfast is very nice, though a bit limited. The beds are amazingly comfy. Overall it is defo a 5* hotel and I will surely visit again."
"19139","It's a bit far from the airport and the main city centre so had to rely on taxis. We used the metro on a few occasions but even that is a 15min walk away so had to get the bus. The lifts are very slow and there's not enough of them. The wifi doesn't give very fast connection so they should invest in a faster service."

"19142","Staff were really friendly, rooms were clean and looked to be recently refurbished, food selection was pretty good, location was ok as only a bus journey away from Dubrovnik old town. Due to it being part of a chain of hotels (Valamar) you were able to use the facilities at the other hotels, which was a bonus."
"19143","The only negative is the evening entertainment, it was pretty non-existent or maybe just a singer/band at the bar."

"19146","A modern hotel from the Spanish chain which has only been opened a year.  Good location in the business area on the dock and only a short walk to central station and direct trains to airport. We were on the 11th floor which had a great view over the city. We only ate breakfast there but offered a good choice. Staff friendly & polite. Whilst at breakfast a member of staff visited each table to check everything ok and what plans people had for the day and could she help with anything. She kindly offered to book a dinner reservation for us that evening at local restaurant and rang me to confirm. Would definitely recommend the hotel. Watch out for the cyclists! "

"19150","We have stayed here a number times over the years since it opened. The hotel is in an excellent position for all the terminals at the airport and especially for terminal 2. It offers good value especially with car parking deals. The hotel is in the process of being totally refurbished with now all the public areas and the superior rooms and business class rooms having been completed"
"19151","We stayed in a standard room which is looking tired and dated. The superior rooms on floors 6 &. 7 and the business class rooms on floors 8 & 9 have all now been totally refurbished and we had a look at one and we were very impressed . The business class lounge manager Ali Karsan showed us around and was very helpfull. There is an excellent business class club lounge on the 9th floor. The standard rooms on floors 4 & 5 will all be refurbished over this summer. "
